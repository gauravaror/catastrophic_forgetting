SUBJECTIVE:i walked away from this new version of e . t . just as i hoped i would -- with moist eyes . 
SUBJECTIVE:though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia's true emotions . . . but at the very least , his secret life will leave you thinking .

SUBJECTIVE:a fascinating , dark thriller that keeps you hooked on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality .

SUBJECTIVE:the writer-director bestows honor -- generously , apolitically -- not only on the dead and still living american veterans who fought in ia drang , but also on their families , on their vietnamese adversaries , and on the families of their adversaries too . 
SUBJECTIVE:perhaps the most remarkable aspect of murderous maids is how restrained and sensitive french director jean-pierre denis keeps his film . 
SUBJECTIVE:the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived-in glow . 
SUBJECTIVE:movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt . 
SUBJECTIVE:what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . 
SUBJECTIVE:evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking . 
SUBJECTIVE:the tonal shifts are jolting , and though wen's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive . 
SUBJECTIVE:the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years . 
SUBJECTIVE:it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
SUBJECTIVE:kapur's contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie that works against itself . 
SUBJECTIVE:a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you haven't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg's work . much of it is funny , but there are also some startling , surrealistic moments . . . 
SUBJECTIVE:beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
SUBJECTIVE:poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures . 
SUBJECTIVE:often messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments , it's very much like life itself . 
SUBJECTIVE:a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending . 
SUBJECTIVE:a captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait , romantic comedy and beat-the-clock thriller . 
SUBJECTIVE:like any good romance , son of the bride , proves it's never too late to learn . 
SUBJECTIVE:for those of an indulgent , slightly sunbaked and summery mind , sex and lucia may well prove diverting enough .

SUBJECTIVE:expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery . 
SUBJECTIVE:a suspense thriller with a brain and a heart . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience . 
SUBJECTIVE:one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking . 
SUBJECTIVE:the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed . 
SUBJECTIVE:epic battles , spectacular effects and multiple story lines make the two towers a most excellent middle chapter in the lord of the rings film trilogy . 
SUBJECTIVE:rarely do films come along that are as intelligent , exuberant , and moving as monsoon wedding . 
SUBJECTIVE:the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament . 
SUBJECTIVE:a sweet-natured reconsideration of one of san francisco's most vital , if least widely recognized , creative fountainheads . 
SUBJECTIVE:based on a devilishly witty script by heather mcgowan and niels mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters
SUBJECTIVE:every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible . that , in itself , is extraordinary . 
SUBJECTIVE:it looks closely , insightfully at fragile , complex relationships . 
SUBJECTIVE:abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 
SUBJECTIVE:even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
SUBJECTIVE:de oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by michel piccoli . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of joan's madness . 
SUBJECTIVE:occasionally funny and consistently odd , and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for zhao . 
SUBJECTIVE:in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
SUBJECTIVE:the actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way . 
SUBJECTIVE:some people march to the beat of a different drum , and if you ever wondered what kind of houses those people live in , this documentary takes a look at 5 alternative housing options . 
SUBJECTIVE:together , miller , kuras and the actresses make personal velocity into an intricate , intimate and intelligent journey . 
SUBJECTIVE:will you go ape over this movie ? well , it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises , but it's definitely worth taking a look . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career , if they want one . 
SUBJECTIVE:look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music . 
SUBJECTIVE:piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
SUBJECTIVE:if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame . 
SUBJECTIVE:even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd .

SUBJECTIVE:good for a few unintentional laughs , " extreme ops " was obviously made for the " xxx " crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction . 
SUBJECTIVE:the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission . 
SUBJECTIVE:overall very good for what it's trying to do . 
SUBJECTIVE:mazel tov to a film about a family's joyous life acting on the yiddish stage . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is christmas future for a lot of baby boomers . 
SUBJECTIVE:koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own . 
SUBJECTIVE:an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood . 
SUBJECTIVE:if routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $8 and get ready for the big shear . this is one baaaaaaaaad movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic . 
SUBJECTIVE:an exciting debut from promising , and fairly disturbed , young director/screenwriter dylan kidd . 
SUBJECTIVE:this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against . 
SUBJECTIVE:the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes , then you'll enjoy the hot chick . 
SUBJECTIVE:as commander-in-chief of this film , bigelow demonstrates a breadth of vision and an attention to detail that propels her into the upper echelons of the directing world . 
SUBJECTIVE:thanks to scott's charismatic roger and eisenberg's sweet nephew , roger dodger is one of the most compelling variations on in the company of men . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds . 
SUBJECTIVE:if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate .

SUBJECTIVE:it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish . 
SUBJECTIVE:an earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool . 
SUBJECTIVE:the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:an empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance . 
SUBJECTIVE:wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives ! 
SUBJECTIVE:what makes blade 2 marginally better than blade , especially if you thought the first was a hollow spectacle ? it has a plot .

SUBJECTIVE:behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise ! 
SUBJECTIVE:a triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light . 
SUBJECTIVE:more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat . 
SUBJECTIVE:at its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers . 
SUBJECTIVE:that haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace . 
SUBJECTIVE:like lisa gossels' children of chabannes ( 2000 ) , which tells another little-known story about french villagers who saved 400 jewish children , shanghai ghetto is a celebration of humanity . 
SUBJECTIVE:the funk brothers seem to have hardly missed a beat . 
SUBJECTIVE:grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length
SUBJECTIVE:what lee does so marvelously compelling is present brown as a catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america . . . sketchy but nevertheless gripping portrait of jim brown , a celebrated wonder in the spotlight
SUBJECTIVE:the country bears wastes an exceptionally good idea . but the movie that doesn't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
SUBJECTIVE:as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan's gifts , which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project . 
SUBJECTIVE:the behind the scenes series is more interesting than the resulting movie , but it's still worth taking a look . 
SUBJECTIVE:woody allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody . but i had a lot of problems with this movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:all very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion . 
SUBJECTIVE:succeeds very well in its primary aim of making us gasp . 
SUBJECTIVE:director rob marshall went out gunning to make a great one . 
SUBJECTIVE:an unflinching , complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen on-screen . 
SUBJECTIVE:a vivid , spicy footnote to history , and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish . 
SUBJECTIVE:a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense . 
SUBJECTIVE:how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know . 
SUBJECTIVE:pan nalin's exposition is beautiful and mysterious , and the interviews that follow , with the practitioners of this ancient indian practice , are as subtle and as enigmatic . 
SUBJECTIVE:by turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious . 
SUBJECTIVE:is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ? 
SUBJECTIVE:gosling creates a staggeringly compelling character , a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory , self-hating , self-destructive ways . 
SUBJECTIVE:you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
SUBJECTIVE:for every inspired bit of absurdity , there's a lame piece of improvisational noodling . 
SUBJECTIVE:the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun . 
SUBJECTIVE:in its combination of religion , love story and exotic locales , " heaven " is a bit reminiscent of james michener's " hawaii , " although this is a somewhat simpler , more personal tale . 
SUBJECTIVE:[reynolds] takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch . 
SUBJECTIVE:strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild . 
SUBJECTIVE:at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot . 
SUBJECTIVE:exciting and direct , with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes . 
SUBJECTIVE:an excellent chance to learn more about one of rock and roll's most significant bands and the struggle for freedom in the communist world . 
SUBJECTIVE:nicholson's understated performance is wonderful . as warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he's neglected over the years . 
SUBJECTIVE:exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran bouquet and the chilling but quite human berling . 
SUBJECTIVE:if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch . 
SUBJECTIVE:the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
SUBJECTIVE:an operatic , sprawling picture that's entertainingly acted , magnificently shot and gripping enough to sustain most of its 170-minute length . 
SUBJECTIVE:the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 
SUBJECTIVE:essentially , this is abel fererra's it's a wonderful life . 
SUBJECTIVE:a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell . 
SUBJECTIVE:the heightened symmetry of this new/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie provides an intimate glimpse of how sensibilities as compatible as oil and water forced themselves to blend and create a successful work despite their aesthetic differences . 
SUBJECTIVE:why spend $9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ? 
SUBJECTIVE:a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you like blood , guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though . . . you will likely enjoy this monster . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they're ghosts imagining themselves as alive . it's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its " men in a sardine can " warped logic . 
SUBJECTIVE:fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it . 
SUBJECTIVE:director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the " miami vice " checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . 
SUBJECTIVE:a clichéd and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite the fact that this film wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be , it's still not a good movie
SUBJECTIVE:the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships . 
SUBJECTIVE:this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does . 
SUBJECTIVE:the aaa of action , xxx is a blast of adrenalin , rated eee for excitement . and vin diesel is the man . 
SUBJECTIVE:all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat . 
SUBJECTIVE:this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f . kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . but it's hardly a necessary enterprise . 
SUBJECTIVE:a hallmark film in an increasingly important film industry and worth the look . 
SUBJECTIVE:too artsy by half , heaven nonetheless casts a spell that doesn't break until you leave the theater . 
SUBJECTIVE:while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target . 
SUBJECTIVE:woo's fights have a distinct flair . his warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos . 
SUBJECTIVE:the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , 'hungry-man portions of bad' . 
SUBJECTIVE:a surprisingly good-natured throwback to the '80s heyday of the body-switching genre . 
SUBJECTIVE:acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes " never again " worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice
SUBJECTIVE:the movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design . 
SUBJECTIVE:on top of a foundering performance , [madonna's] denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 
SUBJECTIVE:martha is rich in contradictions , her tightly wound personality running counter to the sensual pleasure she offers others through her art . 
SUBJECTIVE:the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
SUBJECTIVE:elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 
SUBJECTIVE:a moving story of determination and the human spirit . 
SUBJECTIVE:a film that deserves to be seen regardless of the misgivings . 
SUBJECTIVE:takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker . 
SUBJECTIVE:even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 
SUBJECTIVE:a penetrating glimpse into the tissue-thin ego of the stand-up comic . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is a children's film in the truest sense . it's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it's great for the kids . parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil
SUBJECTIVE:as simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine . this is a movie you can trust . 
SUBJECTIVE:whaley's performance is earnest and often riveting , but he should have taken a few lessons from his peers at amateur night . 
SUBJECTIVE:like rudy yellow lodge , eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider . 
SUBJECTIVE:resident evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you ever wondered what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera , this oscar-nominated documentary takes you there . 
SUBJECTIVE:the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear . 
SUBJECTIVE:this movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it . 
SUBJECTIVE:very annie-mary is familiar but winningly funny and good-hearted . 
SUBJECTIVE:provides a porthole into that noble , trembling incoherence that defines us all . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite bearing the paramount imprint , it's a bargain-basement european pickup . what's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
SUBJECTIVE:post 9/11 the philosophical message of " personal freedom first " might not be as palatable as intended . 
SUBJECTIVE:what makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music . 
SUBJECTIVE:offers a gentle summer fantasy for both grown-ups and little ones . 
SUBJECTIVE:an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
SUBJECTIVE:while its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer's appetite , the film's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving . 
SUBJECTIVE:what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent . 
SUBJECTIVE:the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell . 
SUBJECTIVE:perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission . . . if " gory mayhem " is your idea of a good time . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth . 
SUBJECTIVE:there are moments in this account of the life of artist frida kahlo that are among cinema's finest this year . unfortunately , they're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of kahlo's life imaginable . 
SUBJECTIVE:ratliff speaks the truth about these pentecostal extremists with fairness and compassion , while the well-intentioned churchgoers shout only semi-truths in a frightfully un-christlike fashion .

SUBJECTIVE:what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ? 
SUBJECTIVE:the plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story . but while the highly predictable narrative falls short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold .

SUBJECTIVE: . . . plenty of warmth to go around , with music and laughter and the love of family . 
SUBJECTIVE:[hayek] throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and she gradually makes us believe she is kahlo .

SUBJECTIVE:like " this is spinal tap " , only with more pathetic protagonists- and funnier !

SUBJECTIVE:this sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem . 
SUBJECTIVE:smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way . 
SUBJECTIVE:an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg's the prince of egypt from 1998 . 
SUBJECTIVE:salma goes native and she's never been better in this colorful bio-pic of a mexican icon . 
SUBJECTIVE:a film that is a portrait of grace in an imperfect world . 
SUBJECTIVE:what the movie lacks in action it more than makes up for in drama , suspense , revenge , and romance . 
SUBJECTIVE:relieved of the action-stalling expository responsibility that dogs so many movies based on superhero comics , blade 2 goes straight for the jugular . 
SUBJECTIVE:watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers . 
SUBJECTIVE:hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world . 
SUBJECTIVE:another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:august -- a pupil of ingmar bergman's -- manages to tell a tragic tale while avoiding the heavy-laden angst of a bergman film .
