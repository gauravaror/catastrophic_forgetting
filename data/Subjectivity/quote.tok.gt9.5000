SUBJECTIVE:color , musical bounce and warm seas lapping on island shores . and just enough science to send you home thinking . 
SUBJECTIVE:it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another . 
SUBJECTIVE:a light-hearted french film about the spiritual quest of a fashion model seeking peace of mind while in a love affair with a veterinarian who is a non-practicing jew . 
SUBJECTIVE:my wife is an actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy . in the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more . 
SUBJECTIVE:works both as an engaging drama and an incisive look at the difficulties facing native americans . 
SUBJECTIVE:even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 
SUBJECTIVE:when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart . 
SUBJECTIVE:the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
SUBJECTIVE:the script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material . 
SUBJECTIVE:the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is . 
SUBJECTIVE:directed by david twohy with the same great eye for eerie understatement that he brought to pitch black . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere . 
SUBJECTIVE:provides the kind of 'laugh therapy' i need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending . after seeing 'analyze that , ' i feel better already . 
SUBJECTIVE:worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees . 
SUBJECTIVE:watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite these annoyances , the capable clayburgh and tambor really do a great job of anchoring the characters in the emotional realities of middle age . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a good thing that woolly mammoths are extinct , because this movie will have every kid in the schoolyard wishing for their very own . 
SUBJECTIVE:preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . 
SUBJECTIVE:4ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as pokemon videos , but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly . 
SUBJECTIVE:si el siglo xxi necesita de héroes , el hombre araña parece haber llegado para quedarse . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins . 
SUBJECTIVE:it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
SUBJECTIVE:writer/director walter hill is in his hypermasculine element here , once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable . 
SUBJECTIVE:hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script . 
SUBJECTIVE:extremely well cast , especially in the large number of supporting roles . 
SUBJECTIVE:a chilling tale of one of the great crimes of 20th century france : the murder of two rich women by their servants in 1933 . 
SUBJECTIVE:a dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation . 
SUBJECTIVE:impostor doesn't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast . 
SUBJECTIVE:though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you can keep your eyes open amid all the blood and gore , you'll see del toro has brought unexpected gravity to blade ii . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
SUBJECTIVE:a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
SUBJECTIVE:it helps that lil bow wow . . . tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid . 
SUBJECTIVE:a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1/2 . 
SUBJECTIVE:eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 
SUBJECTIVE:nair doesn't use [monsoon wedding] to lament the loss of culture . instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions . 
SUBJECTIVE:stuffed to the brim with ideas , american instigator michael moore's film is a rambling examination of american gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . a joke at once flaky and resonant , lightweight and bizarrely original . 
SUBJECTIVE:fontaine's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal . 
SUBJECTIVE:starts slowly , but adrien brody – in the title role – helps make the film's conclusion powerful and satisfying . 
SUBJECTIVE:a refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market . 
SUBJECTIVE:you really have to salute writer-director haneke ( he adapted elfriede jelinek's novel ) for making a film that isn't nearly as graphic but much more powerful , brutally shocking and difficult to watch . 
SUBJECTIVE:barry convinces us he's a dangerous , secretly unhinged guy who could easily have killed a president because it made him feel powerful . 
SUBJECTIVE:a distant , even sterile , yet compulsively watchable look at the sordid life of hogan's heroes star bob crane . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter . 
SUBJECTIVE:director dan verete uses his camera as the metaphoric needle , and his cast in each segment as his thread , to form a sweeping tapestry of mis-explanation and contention . 
SUBJECTIVE:waydowntown just like most large cities , isn't somewhere you'll want to spend the rest of your life , but it sure is a fun place to visit for a while . 
SUBJECTIVE:the acting in pauline and paulette is good all round , but what really sets the film apart is debrauwer's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons . 
SUBJECTIVE:the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's lots of cool stuff packed into espn's ultimate x . 
SUBJECTIVE:it gets old quickly . watch barbershop again if you're in need of a cube fix--this isn't worth sitting through . 
SUBJECTIVE:harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's the kind of film where the villain even gives an evil look for his passport photo . how can you resist that ? 
SUBJECTIVE:plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year . 
SUBJECTIVE:a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 
SUBJECTIVE:just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
SUBJECTIVE:with a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages , this cinderella story doesn't have a single surprise up its sleeve . but it does somehow manage to get you under its spell . 
SUBJECTIVE:a charming trifle . . . a welcome return to jocular form . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller . 
SUBJECTIVE:without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter . 
SUBJECTIVE:little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 
SUBJECTIVE:anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going . 
SUBJECTIVE:every defiantly over-the-top action scene -- from high-stakes car chases to fearsome drug busts -- seizes your adrenal gland and milks it like an epileptic farmer .

SUBJECTIVE:skip work to see it at the first opportunity . 
SUBJECTIVE:both the film and nachtwey's photos hammer home the grim reality of the world's gutters and battlefields , and will make you question what 'news' really is . 
SUBJECTIVE:so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something . 
SUBJECTIVE:shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes . 
SUBJECTIVE:that 'alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) . . . 
SUBJECTIVE:against all odds in heaven and hell , it creeped me out just fine . 
SUBJECTIVE:nicely combines the enigmatic features of 'memento' with the hallucinatory drug culture of 'requiem for a dream . '
SUBJECTIVE:it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come . 
SUBJECTIVE:japan's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date . 
SUBJECTIVE:the work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them . strange occurrences build in the mind of the viewer and take on extreme urgency .

SUBJECTIVE:while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise . 
SUBJECTIVE:while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity . 
SUBJECTIVE:ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
SUBJECTIVE:es divertida , visualmente espectacular y muy entretenida . simple y sencillamente te sorprenderá . 
SUBJECTIVE:not since japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa's ran have the savagery of combat and the specter of death been visualized with such operatic grandeur . 
SUBJECTIVE:the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch . 
SUBJECTIVE:the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo . 
SUBJECTIVE:the next big thing's not-so-big ( and not-so-hot ) directorial debut . 
SUBJECTIVE:the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing . 
SUBJECTIVE:judging from the strength of this superbly enigmatic film , oliveira himself seems far from ready to go home . 
SUBJECTIVE:passionate , irrational , long-suffering but cruel as a tarantula , helga figures prominently in this movie , and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats . 
SUBJECTIVE:christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
SUBJECTIVE:aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships . 
SUBJECTIVE:if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie is pretty funny now and then without in any way demeaning its subjects . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . 
SUBJECTIVE:when your subject is illusion versus reality , shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real ? 
SUBJECTIVE:confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it . 
SUBJECTIVE:sitting in the third row of the imax cinema at sydney's darling harbour , but i sometimes felt as though i was in the tiny two seater plane that carried the giant camera around australia , sweeping and gliding , banking and hovering over some of the most not
SUBJECTIVE:may be far from the best of the series , but it's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation . 
SUBJECTIVE:the result reverberates on the screen with a deadly force and fury more intense than anything mr . scorsese has yet achieved on the meanest and most beloved streets he could imagine or recall . 
SUBJECTIVE:it has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience . 
SUBJECTIVE:the leaping story line , shaped by director peter kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions , shows all the signs of rich detail condensed into a few evocative images and striking character traits . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
SUBJECTIVE:for a rapsploitation film to target and frown upon the darker forces of its nature is certainly a good sign for the maturation of the genre . 
SUBJECTIVE:a movie that doesn't aim too high , but doesn't need to . 
SUBJECTIVE:the kind of movie that seduces you into becoming putty in its manipulative card-sharking hands and making you enjoy being taken in by its shameless contrivance . 
SUBJECTIVE:an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either . 
SUBJECTIVE:the best part about " gangs " was daniel day-lewis . 
SUBJECTIVE:the work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims . 
SUBJECTIVE:rarely has skin looked as beautiful , desirable , even delectable , as it does in trouble every day . 
SUBJECTIVE:the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie's hideous yellow 'do . 
SUBJECTIVE:the plan to make enough into ‘an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt's , no matter if it's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale . 
SUBJECTIVE:raunchy though [cho's] material is , it embraces all comers , regardless of gender , sexuality , race or ethnicity . and it's never been sharper -- or funnier -- than it is here . 
SUBJECTIVE:fans of behan's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy . 
SUBJECTIVE:miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 
SUBJECTIVE:human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . 
SUBJECTIVE:anchored by friel and williams's exceptional performances , the film's power lies in its complexity . nothing is black and white . 
SUBJECTIVE:the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
SUBJECTIVE:like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end . 
SUBJECTIVE:it has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing . 
SUBJECTIVE:what one is left with , even after the most awful acts are committed , is an overwhelming sadness that feels as if it has made its way into your very bloodstream . 
SUBJECTIVE:a competent , unpretentious entertainment destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country . 
SUBJECTIVE:louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense . 
SUBJECTIVE:an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living . 
SUBJECTIVE:we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat . 
SUBJECTIVE:as it turns out , you can go home again . 
SUBJECTIVE:using his audience as a figurative port-of-call , dong pulls his even-handed ideological ship to their dock for unloading , before he continues his longer journey still ahead . 
SUBJECTIVE:in the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . 
SUBJECTIVE:instead of trying to bust some blondes , [diggs] should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man . 
SUBJECTIVE:even if the world doesn't see things the way [michael moore] does , his questions are worth asking . … and bowling for columbine benefits from his iconoclastic zeal . 
SUBJECTIVE:the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
SUBJECTIVE:scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern lothario . 
SUBJECTIVE:about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men . 
SUBJECTIVE:automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
SUBJECTIVE:part of the film's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz . 
SUBJECTIVE:a very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage . 
SUBJECTIVE:one of the best cat-and-mouse movies to come along in a while , leo has great fun in the role . 
SUBJECTIVE:kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
SUBJECTIVE:who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '
SUBJECTIVE:open-ended and composed of layer upon layer , talk to her is a cinephile's feast , an invitation to countless interpretations . 
SUBJECTIVE:with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , the spy kids franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a james bond series for kids . 
SUBJECTIVE:oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between . 
SUBJECTIVE:resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
SUBJECTIVE:the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . 
SUBJECTIVE:a moving and weighty depiction of one family's attempts to heal after the death of a child . 
SUBJECTIVE:a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left . 
SUBJECTIVE:depending upon your reaction to this movie , you may never again be able to look at a red felt sharpie pen without disgust , a thrill , or the giggles . 
SUBJECTIVE:la cinta comienza intentando ser un drama , rápidamente se transforma en una comedia y termina por ser una parodia absolutamente predecible
SUBJECTIVE:watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost . 
SUBJECTIVE:a thoroughly unoriginal , but fast-paced and entertaining genre b-flick
SUBJECTIVE:a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . devastatingly direct to the heart of the matter , demonstrating that there is no easy walk toward peace in a region with such strong conflicting traditions
SUBJECTIVE:a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers . 
SUBJECTIVE:a heartfelt , understated and occasionally heavy-handed slice of heartland . 
SUBJECTIVE:mostly , [goldbacher] just lets her complicated characters be unruly , confusing and , through it all , human . 
SUBJECTIVE:let's issue a moratorium , effective immediately , on treacly films about inspirational prep-school professors and the children they so heartwarmingly motivate . 
SUBJECTIVE:how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough . 
SUBJECTIVE:treats a potentially explosive set-up with adult reflection and thoughtfulness . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
SUBJECTIVE:most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . 
SUBJECTIVE:i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 
SUBJECTIVE:[majidi] makes us think twice about immigrants we see around us every day . 
SUBJECTIVE:not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream american audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit . 
SUBJECTIVE:but this is lohman's film . her performance moves between heartbreak and rebellion as she continually tries to accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks . 
SUBJECTIVE:this tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , nicholas meyer's star trek vi : the undiscovered country . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it . 
SUBJECTIVE:broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
SUBJECTIVE:neither the funniest film that eddie murphy nor robert de niro has ever made , showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while . before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . 
SUBJECTIVE:any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years . 
SUBJECTIVE:at best , cletis tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience . 
SUBJECTIVE:niccol the filmmaker merges his collaborators' symbolic images with his words , insinuating , for example , that in hollywood , only god speaks to the press
SUBJECTIVE:it treats us to beautiful insights and tragic struggles that swell the heart and make us feel genuine empathy for two people embracing the truth amidst a pack of lies . 
SUBJECTIVE:completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . 
SUBJECTIVE:not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid . 
SUBJECTIVE:this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow . 
SUBJECTIVE:the overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries . 
SUBJECTIVE:mr . jacobi's recitation is illustrated with a rush of sensuous nature imagery , beautifully photographed by mr . cox and hans sonneveld and underscored with a lush soundtrack by paul grabowsky . 
SUBJECTIVE:the acting is uniformly excellent , with kyra sedgwick and fairuza balk in particular deserving to be singled out for praise . 
SUBJECTIVE:who needs mind-bending drugs when they can see this , the final part of the 'qatsi' trilogy , directed by godfrey reggio , with music by philip glass ? 
SUBJECTIVE:'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
SUBJECTIVE:a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years . 
SUBJECTIVE:it all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time . 
SUBJECTIVE:reminiscent of david mamet's elaborate screen bluffs -- only livelier , more playful . 
SUBJECTIVE:the cast , collectively a successful example of the lovable-loser protagonist , shows deft comic timing . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you love motown music , you'll love this documentary . 
SUBJECTIVE:provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust . 
SUBJECTIVE:stephen rea , aidan quinn , and alan bates play desmond's legal eagles , and when joined by brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , 'tis . 
SUBJECTIVE:the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them . 
SUBJECTIVE:minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report . 
SUBJECTIVE:[reno] delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion . 
SUBJECTIVE:inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it's not that , it's the tension that keeps you in your seat . affleck and jackson are good sparring partners . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time . 
SUBJECTIVE:the most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from portugal . 
SUBJECTIVE:one hour photo offers a very interesting snapshot of some decidedly modern pathologies -- suburban alienation and the illusions generated by the advent of the photographic image . 
SUBJECTIVE:it showcases carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff . 
SUBJECTIVE:it is best appreciated as an immersion in a three-dimensional toyland outfitted with enough whimsical gadgetry to fill a thousand playrooms . 
SUBJECTIVE:children may not understand everything that happens -- i'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted . 
SUBJECTIVE:the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
SUBJECTIVE:nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength , but it's propelled by the acting . 
SUBJECTIVE:focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her " madness " so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device . 
SUBJECTIVE:a chance to see three splendid actors turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody , and to belong to somebody . 
SUBJECTIVE:the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere . 
SUBJECTIVE:for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . 
SUBJECTIVE:a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . 
SUBJECTIVE:the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . 
SUBJECTIVE:this slight slice of l . a . life is distinguished by two fine , subtle performances . 
SUBJECTIVE:for all the wit and hoopla , festival in cannes offers rare insight into the structure of relationships . 
SUBJECTIVE:'a fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . '
SUBJECTIVE:making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film isn't especially dynamic , but it brims with insightful , poignant memories from survivors . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's no denying how nice it is to see veteran actors bob hoskins , michael caine and helen mirren interacting with each other on screen . 
SUBJECTIVE:vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much . 
SUBJECTIVE:between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap . 
SUBJECTIVE:great fun both for sports aficionados and for ordinary louts whose idea of exercise is climbing the steps of a stadium-seat megaplex . 
SUBJECTIVE:a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is , not to put too fine a point on it , a swashbuckler , a costume drama . if you love that old story form , you will be in old-fogy heaven , as it is nearly a perfect example of a genre that died out years ago . 
SUBJECTIVE:like to think of the film as local hero for kids , as the boy has to adapt from his urban kid lifestyle to the slow , simple ways of generations before . will he do it ? will it work out ? can love overcome ? 
SUBJECTIVE:bisset still commands the screen as the graceful and outspoken frances . 
SUBJECTIVE:for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded . 
SUBJECTIVE:tsai has a well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world's great visual stylists , and in this film , every shot enhances the excellent performances . 
SUBJECTIVE:lazy , miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year . 
SUBJECTIVE:the story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:as underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . 
SUBJECTIVE:i don't even care that there's no plot in this antonio banderas-lucy liu faceoff . it's still terrible ! 
SUBJECTIVE:in its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately . 
SUBJECTIVE:city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery . 
SUBJECTIVE:there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time . 
SUBJECTIVE:the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character . 
SUBJECTIVE:apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 
SUBJECTIVE:the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter . 
SUBJECTIVE:stage director sam mendes showcases tom hanks as a depression era hit-man in this dark tale of revenge . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course . 
SUBJECTIVE:though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial . 
SUBJECTIVE:being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .

SUBJECTIVE:the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
SUBJECTIVE:a well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a ‘direct-to-video' release . 
SUBJECTIVE:a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
SUBJECTIVE:largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . 
SUBJECTIVE:as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting . 
SUBJECTIVE:the large-frame imax camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers . 
SUBJECTIVE:performances are potent , and the women's stories are ably intercut and involving . 
SUBJECTIVE:peter jackson has done the nearly impossible . he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper . what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery

SUBJECTIVE:it's a humble effort , but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos , especially between morgan and redgrave . 
SUBJECTIVE:for his first attempt at film noir , spielberg presents a fascinating but flawed look at the near future . 
SUBJECTIVE:the process of figuring out the moment the movie re-imagines the battle of the bulge with a bare-chested guardsman and a pike is more than worth the price of admission . 
SUBJECTIVE:it looks good , but it is essentially empty . 
SUBJECTIVE:this documentary by stacy peralta makes a convincing case on behalf of skateboarding , of all things , as a catalyst for this change , and for some delinquent youths in a derelict los angeles neighborhood as its agents . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of . 
SUBJECTIVE:weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he doesn't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . 
SUBJECTIVE:by the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest cannot be revived . 
SUBJECTIVE:directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name

SUBJECTIVE:it's a movie -- and an album -- you won't want to miss . 
SUBJECTIVE:a work of the utmost subtlety and perception , it marks the outstanding feature debut of writer-director eric byler , who understands the power of the implicit and the virtues of simplicity and economy . 
SUBJECTIVE:in their love for each other and their ability to move on , the women are , in a way , lovely and amazing . 
SUBJECTIVE:not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
SUBJECTIVE:directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better . 
SUBJECTIVE:delia , greta , and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year . as each of them searches for their place in the world , miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking , flawed humanity . 
SUBJECTIVE:what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class . 
SUBJECTIVE:diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . 
SUBJECTIVE:offers big , fat , dumb laughs that may make you hate yourself for giving in . ah , what the hell . 
SUBJECTIVE:the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers . 
SUBJECTIVE:sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house . 
SUBJECTIVE:the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive . 
SUBJECTIVE:that rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once . 
SUBJECTIVE:like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
SUBJECTIVE:this version does justice both to stevenson and to the sci-fi genre . 
SUBJECTIVE:australia : land beyond time is an enjoyable big movie primarily because australia is a weirdly beautiful place . 
SUBJECTIVE:tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star . 
SUBJECTIVE:a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .

SUBJECTIVE:[n]o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness . 
SUBJECTIVE:never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man . the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms . ambrose . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . more evocative than many other anime features , with its echoes of classic science fiction and contemporary cyberpunk . 
SUBJECTIVE:there are some wonderfully fresh moments that smooth the moral stiffness with human kindness and hopefulness . 
SUBJECTIVE:bollywood/hollywood is a happy , carefree trifle of a movie that is easy to savour because it is so undemanding yet so rewarding . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget . 
SUBJECTIVE:even if you've seen " stomp " ( the stage show ) , you still have to see this ! 
SUBJECTIVE:casting its gaze on painting masterworks and thousands of jewel-encrusted , elaborately costumed extras , russian ark is like nothing you've ever seen . 
SUBJECTIVE:brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate . 
SUBJECTIVE:time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool " clockstoppers , " but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . 
SUBJECTIVE:no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make . 
SUBJECTIVE:warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message . i loved this film . 
SUBJECTIVE:weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell . 
SUBJECTIVE:has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together . 
SUBJECTIVE:more entertaining than much of the big-studio schlock out there . 
SUBJECTIVE:by the end , you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich ( that would be reno ) gets his comeuppance . just bring on the battle bots , please ! 
SUBJECTIVE:i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind . 
SUBJECTIVE:a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:kidd deals with lust and egoism the way a surgeon is interested in a tumor . he exposes ugly attitudes but maintains compassion for his mean-spirited subject . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there's no scene that screams " bathroom break ! " 
SUBJECTIVE:in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . pray doesn't have a passion for the material . he nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race . 
SUBJECTIVE:somehow ms . griffiths and mr . pryce bring off this wild welsh whimsy . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's everything you don't go to the movies for . 
SUBJECTIVE:first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people . 
SUBJECTIVE:ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing . 
SUBJECTIVE:spider-man is in the same category as x-men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around . 
SUBJECTIVE:unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate . 
SUBJECTIVE:chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:[hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through . 
SUBJECTIVE:it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense . 
SUBJECTIVE:full of unforgiving irony and quiet realism , a song for martin stands as a powerful and moving achievement . 
SUBJECTIVE:even with harris's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear's soul-stripping breakdown . 
SUBJECTIVE:while cherish doesn't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller , it's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem . 
SUBJECTIVE: " maid in manhattan " is a charmer , a pc " pretty woman " that ditches the odious prostitution theme for class commentary
SUBJECTIVE:mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
SUBJECTIVE:a generic international version of a typical american horror film . 
SUBJECTIVE:even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad . 
SUBJECTIVE:every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film has an infectious enthusiasm and we're touched by the film's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you , then you're at the right film . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime . 
SUBJECTIVE:the longer one watches this determinedly ragged portrait of blue-collar teenage desperation . . . the more one gets absorbed in the utter unbridled nihilism of its 'characters . '
SUBJECTIVE:unfortunately this film will not satisfy if you are looking to discover the missing link , but if you are simply interested in humor and some 'interesting' footage , to say the least , you will not be disappointed . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's like rocky and bullwinkle on speed , but that's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie's strangeness . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music . there are slow and repetitive parts , but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's pithy without being saccharine ; it's funny without ever not taking itself seriously ; it's full of beautiful characters and great performances . 
SUBJECTIVE:unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor . 
SUBJECTIVE:plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial . 
SUBJECTIVE: " punch-drunk love " is a little like a chocolate milk moustache . . . 
SUBJECTIVE:normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable . 
SUBJECTIVE:this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring . 
SUBJECTIVE:morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start . 
SUBJECTIVE:the year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but take care of my cat emerges as the very best of them . 
SUBJECTIVE:the plot mechanics of read my lips eventually kind of spin into a fairly conventional thriller , but the wildly talented cassel and the unconventionally alluring devos give this movie a unique feel . 
SUBJECTIVE:pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
SUBJECTIVE:like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest . 
SUBJECTIVE:what it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and b-grade stylishness . 
SUBJECTIVE:the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's endearing to hear madame d . refer to her husband as 'jackie' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer . 
SUBJECTIVE:bravely explores the psychic damage inflicted on jean-luc by a withholding , then absent parent . 
SUBJECTIVE:isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that . 
SUBJECTIVE:like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
SUBJECTIVE:it's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood . 
SUBJECTIVE:the chaotic lead characters are not the sorts one will usually see in a disney film and that makes for a certain amount of unpredictability before it all returns to business as usual . 
SUBJECTIVE:the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones . 
SUBJECTIVE:jackass : the movie is a disgusting , repulsive , grotesque spectacle , but it's also hilarious and provocative . god help me , thumbs up .

SUBJECTIVE:an unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see . 
SUBJECTIVE:you'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it . 
SUBJECTIVE:stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here… . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
SUBJECTIVE:a charming and funny story of clashing cultures and a clashing mother/daughter relationship . 
SUBJECTIVE:so saccharine , i'm not sure i'd be able to take it under normal conditions . 
SUBJECTIVE:worth catching for griffiths' warm and winning central performance . 
SUBJECTIVE:waiting for godard can be fruitful : 'in praise of love' is the director's epitaph for himself . 
SUBJECTIVE:with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap . 
SUBJECTIVE:hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the u . s . -- a major director is emerging in world cinema . 
SUBJECTIVE:this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage . 
SUBJECTIVE:some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent . 
SUBJECTIVE:behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one can't help but think he'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art . 
SUBJECTIVE:the story is timeless , but when adapted to the modern age , it makes for a wrenching film -- never preachy or sentimental , and refreshingly non-judgmental about the fundamental and contradictory issues it raises . 
SUBJECTIVE:a stormy french adolescent drama about friendship , family , and sexual politics . 
SUBJECTIVE:satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity . 
SUBJECTIVE:while the topic has grown heavier here , [moretti's] touch has not , and that disparity is precisely what gives the film its sustained poignancy . 
SUBJECTIVE:this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 
SUBJECTIVE:deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate . 
SUBJECTIVE:all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness . 
SUBJECTIVE:the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .

SUBJECTIVE:what doesn't this film have that an impressionable kid couldn't stand to hear ? 
SUBJECTIVE:this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . 
SUBJECTIVE:really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back . 
SUBJECTIVE:as janice , eileen walsh , an engaging , wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm . 
SUBJECTIVE: " 13 conversations about one thing " is an intelligent flick that examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling .

SUBJECTIVE:the importance of being earnest , so thick with wit it plays like a reading from bartlett's familiar quotations
SUBJECTIVE:for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league .

SUBJECTIVE:a well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog . 
SUBJECTIVE:the performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye . 
SUBJECTIVE:a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .

SUBJECTIVE:boasts enough funny dialogue and sharp characterizations to be mildly amusing . 
SUBJECTIVE:it is von sydow who gives intacto its gravity , resonance , soul . 
SUBJECTIVE:a compelling allegory about the last days of germany's democratic weimar republic . 
SUBJECTIVE:it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
SUBJECTIVE:the problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart . 
SUBJECTIVE:the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . 
SUBJECTIVE:to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you grew up on scooby -- you'll love this movie . matthew lillard is born to play shaggy ! 
SUBJECTIVE:a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls . 
SUBJECTIVE:the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .

SUBJECTIVE:comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief . 
SUBJECTIVE:at times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated ( depending upon where you live ) , ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two . 
SUBJECTIVE:in addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry . 
SUBJECTIVE:a fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys . 
SUBJECTIVE:with a completely predictable plot , you'll swear that you've seen it all before , even if you've never come within a mile of the longest yard . 
SUBJECTIVE:there are problems with this film that even 3 oscar winners can't overcome , but it's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling .

SUBJECTIVE:an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers . 
SUBJECTIVE: " an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . " 
SUBJECTIVE:i certainly found its depiction of a family affected by grief far more believable and effective than the strident dish-breaking , breast-beating of in the bedroom . 
SUBJECTIVE:i'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about . 
SUBJECTIVE:more intimate than spectacular , e . t . is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . 
SUBJECTIVE:too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization . 
SUBJECTIVE:it is intensely personal and yet -- unlike quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times . 
SUBJECTIVE:amold&oacute ; var is a master of emotional texture , peeling away layer upon layer of the feelings . . . until he reaches benigno's troubled psyche and marco's benevolent soul . 
SUBJECTIVE:so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 
SUBJECTIVE:the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that's where this film should have remained . 
SUBJECTIVE:reign of fire just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is one of the most visually stunning and thematically moving epics in recent memory , and in spite of numerous minor flaws , scorsese's best in more than a decade . 
SUBJECTIVE:an intelligently made ( and beautifully edited ) picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch . 
SUBJECTIVE:if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
SUBJECTIVE:the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 
SUBJECTIVE:a compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day . 
SUBJECTIVE:the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable .

SUBJECTIVE:going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
SUBJECTIVE:many of benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of miami vice . 
SUBJECTIVE:dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
SUBJECTIVE:it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color . 
SUBJECTIVE:it may not be " last tango in paris " but . . . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's much tongue in cheek in the film and there's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all . 
SUBJECTIVE:care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters . 
SUBJECTIVE:the limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:a moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine . 
SUBJECTIVE:a psychological thriller that doesn't really hold up if you think about it too much , but is nonetheless highly entertaining in a low-budget , david lynch-ian way . 
SUBJECTIVE:part of the long , noble tradition ( at least since the '90s ) of talky , ensemble-driven american indies . 
SUBJECTIVE:this odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in morton's ever-watchful gaze -- and it's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one . 
SUBJECTIVE:as directed by dani kouyate of burkina faso , sia lacks visual flair . but kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them . 
SUBJECTIVE:although melodramatic and predictable , this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five filipino-americans and their frantic efforts to find love .

SUBJECTIVE:dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite . 
SUBJECTIVE:slowly but surely devolves into a fascinating , cringe-inducing portrait of cultural solipsism , climaxing in an emotional meltdown that wouldn't look out of place in mid-period cassavetes . 
SUBJECTIVE:a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . 
SUBJECTIVE:scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's hard not to like a film that has sky divers jumping out of helicopters to catch flying dragons in a big net . 
SUBJECTIVE:none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
SUBJECTIVE:what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
SUBJECTIVE:this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
SUBJECTIVE:to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man . 
SUBJECTIVE:plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .

SUBJECTIVE:its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up . 
SUBJECTIVE:just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever . 
SUBJECTIVE:a little weak -- and it isn't that funny .

SUBJECTIVE:if the count of monte cristo doesn't transform caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago . 
SUBJECTIVE:so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 
SUBJECTIVE:a muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us . 
SUBJECTIVE:a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe . 
SUBJECTIVE:quiet , sexual , disturbing , often beautifully melancholic . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
SUBJECTIVE:the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
SUBJECTIVE:no way i can believe this load of junk . 
SUBJECTIVE:its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 
SUBJECTIVE:what the director can&#8217 ; t do is make either of val kilmer&#8217 ; s two personas interesting or worth caring about . 
SUBJECTIVE:[grant's] bumbling magic takes over the film , and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle . 
SUBJECTIVE:renner's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing . 
SUBJECTIVE:all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility . 
SUBJECTIVE:what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it's an enjoyable one . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne . 
SUBJECTIVE:prancing his way through the tailor-made part of a male hooker approaching the end of his vitality , jagger obviously relishes every self-mocking moment . 
SUBJECTIVE:carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
SUBJECTIVE:this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . there's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise . 
SUBJECTIVE:riveting when it focuses on the challenges of crossing a generational divide . 
SUBJECTIVE:a fanciful drama about napoleon's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility . 
SUBJECTIVE:for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
SUBJECTIVE:the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
SUBJECTIVE:with all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen . . . his secret life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles . 
SUBJECTIVE:a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
SUBJECTIVE:viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who's who in this pretentious mess . 
SUBJECTIVE:jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness . 
SUBJECTIVE:has a shambling charm . . . a cheerfully inconsequential diversion . 
SUBJECTIVE:a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's their familial ups and downs that shift this small , stubbornly poignant documentary . . . from the realm of special-interest audiences to the more universal theater of family psychodynamics . 
SUBJECTIVE:watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend . you don't want to call the cops . you want to call domino's . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing . 
SUBJECTIVE:holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life's messiness from inside out , in all its strange quirks . 
SUBJECTIVE:genuine movie magic . . . it transports you to a place somewhere between eavesdropping voyeur and silent referee . 
SUBJECTIVE:a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum . 
SUBJECTIVE:it picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite the film's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity . 
SUBJECTIVE:it has something of the aura of four weddings and a funeral about it , mixed in with a bit of bridget jones's diary , but the movie's just too different , too risky for huge popularity . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . the plot weaves us into a complex web . 
SUBJECTIVE:a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 
SUBJECTIVE:i enjoyed " formula 51 " in a guilty kind of way
SUBJECTIVE:even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
SUBJECTIVE:the château would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens . 
SUBJECTIVE:novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach . 
SUBJECTIVE:the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
SUBJECTIVE:could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals . 
SUBJECTIVE:a reminder that beyond all the hype and recent digital glitz , spielberg knows how to tell us about people . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
SUBJECTIVE:if your senses haven't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket . 
SUBJECTIVE:the off-center humor is a constant , and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery . 
SUBJECTIVE:as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
SUBJECTIVE:'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '
SUBJECTIVE:best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein's life would do better elsewhere . 
SUBJECTIVE:with we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in . 
SUBJECTIVE:like a fish that's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places . 
SUBJECTIVE:the sequel drops the adult aspects of the story in favor of talking reindeer and a life-size , plastic santa replacement ( also played by allen ) that is strongly reminiscent of that creepy family from the duracell commercials . 
SUBJECTIVE:an unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title . 
SUBJECTIVE:a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores . 
SUBJECTIVE:what emerges is not only an underdog v . simon bar sinister saga but a fascinating character study . 
SUBJECTIVE:mehta expertly fashions a fascinating hybrid that is sure to delight audiences with its good-natured and well-timed humor , and its unabashed refusal to take itself seriously . 
SUBJECTIVE:adaptation's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary . 
SUBJECTIVE:the best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites . 
SUBJECTIVE:add yet another hat to a talented head , clooney's a good director . 
SUBJECTIVE:the crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us . 
SUBJECTIVE:swimming isn't a major film . nor does it try to be . but what , in the end , is a major film ? if it's one that accomplishes what it sets out to do , then we ought to correct ourselves . 
SUBJECTIVE:obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script . 
SUBJECTIVE:on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there . 
SUBJECTIVE:embarrassed myself about laughing out loud multiple times , i found myself enjoying the movie much more than i ever enjoyed the tv show . . . and these pseudo-homo-erotic stunts . 
SUBJECTIVE:aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters . 
SUBJECTIVE:part of the draw of dance is the impossibility to define its particular joy . tavernier's film conveys a large element of its appeal -- and more . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite its faults , this is a fascinating look at a subculture . 
SUBJECTIVE:less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much . 
SUBJECTIVE:the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
SUBJECTIVE:an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
SUBJECTIVE:sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 
SUBJECTIVE:mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
SUBJECTIVE:shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies . 
SUBJECTIVE:huppert's superbly controlled display of murderous vulnerability ensures that malice has a very human face . 
SUBJECTIVE:makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man's greatness . 
SUBJECTIVE:as an entertainment , the movie keeps you diverted and best of all , it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting . 
SUBJECTIVE:most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence . 
SUBJECTIVE:so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
SUBJECTIVE:any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
SUBJECTIVE:a tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty . 
SUBJECTIVE:professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller . 
SUBJECTIVE:a pointed , often tender , examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties . 
SUBJECTIVE:ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
SUBJECTIVE:i basically went in expecting garbage , but color me surprised when it actually turned out to be quite funny ! 
SUBJECTIVE:the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries . 
SUBJECTIVE:turning a great movie into a pretty good one is still a step in the wrong direction . . . and the ring will never be more than a pretty good movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:formula 51 is pretty much quentin tarantino meets guy ritchie , as directed by ronny yu . however , if you like that sort of thing , as i do , you just might have some fun with the chemical imbalance of formula 51 . 
SUBJECTIVE:at once emotional and richly analytical , the cosby-seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose , larky documentary . 
SUBJECTIVE:the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
SUBJECTIVE:i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche . 
SUBJECTIVE:the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
SUBJECTIVE:an engaging documentary about people who live in unusual homes . 
SUBJECTIVE:kung pow is oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that . 
SUBJECTIVE:a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
SUBJECTIVE:sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
SUBJECTIVE:secretary is not a movie about fetishism . it is a movie about passion . 
SUBJECTIVE:it proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study . 
SUBJECTIVE:outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride . 
SUBJECTIVE:though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal . 
SUBJECTIVE:everyone should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting . 
SUBJECTIVE:those with a modicum of patience will find in these characters' foibles a timeless and unique perspective . 
SUBJECTIVE:swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you're part of her targeted audience , you'll cheer . otherwise , maybe . 
SUBJECTIVE:julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan . 
SUBJECTIVE:the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
SUBJECTIVE:not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at . 
SUBJECTIVE:viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
SUBJECTIVE:as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau . 
SUBJECTIVE:charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated . just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective . 
SUBJECTIVE:for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
SUBJECTIVE:unlike most anime , whose most ardent fans outside japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes , metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:trailer park magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all . 
SUBJECTIVE:thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents
SUBJECTIVE:de oliveira seems not only to have read john berger's famous essay on looking , but also to have taken it as his personal instruction manual for filmmaking . 
SUBJECTIVE:a great ensemble cast can't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar . 
SUBJECTIVE:what better message than 'love thyself' could young women of any size receive ? 
SUBJECTIVE:the exposition does pay off , if you can stay awake that long . there's little gripping in the film until the second hour . 
SUBJECTIVE:lan yu seems altogether too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece . it is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it . 
SUBJECTIVE:in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
SUBJECTIVE:a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino . 
SUBJECTIVE:philip k . dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach . 
SUBJECTIVE:sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first ( as best i remember ) , but still a very good time at the cinema . 
SUBJECTIVE:hoffman spends a good deal of screen time alone and without much dialogue , using only his considerable physical skill and screen presence to pull off the role . 
SUBJECTIVE:macbeth . mcdonald's . how far apart these poles of popular culture seemed until billy morrissette's sly mcshakespeare crime comedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:bielinsky's script is slick and fiendishly clever , with seemingly a twist a minute . 
SUBJECTIVE:sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
SUBJECTIVE:in the pianist , polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say , confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions , and he allows nothing to get in the way . 
SUBJECTIVE:romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
SUBJECTIVE:comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire . 
SUBJECTIVE:the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
SUBJECTIVE:first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it's kinda dumb . and second , what's with all the shooting ? 
SUBJECTIVE:drumline is a movie that treats its characters and audience with respect ; it can't be accused of being a dumbed-down teen comedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly , this is surely what they'd look like . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you're willing to have fun with it , you won't feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful . 
SUBJECTIVE:not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made . 
SUBJECTIVE:the main story . . . is compelling enough , but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish . 
SUBJECTIVE:[a] wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting . 
SUBJECTIVE:cannon's confidence and laid-back good spirits are , with the drumming routines , among the film's saving graces . 
SUBJECTIVE:winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic , achieving some honest insight into relationships that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars . 
SUBJECTIVE:culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable . 
SUBJECTIVE:i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
SUBJECTIVE:to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
SUBJECTIVE:adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse . 
SUBJECTIVE:transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals and offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring-do puts the x into the games . 
SUBJECTIVE:unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook . 
SUBJECTIVE:beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of grenoble and geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself . 
SUBJECTIVE:it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back . 
SUBJECTIVE:the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film . . . or the emotional integrity of the performances . 
SUBJECTIVE:with youthful high spirits , tautou remains captivating throughout michele's religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a drawling , slobbering , lovable run-on sentence of a film , a southern gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack . 
SUBJECTIVE:alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick . 
SUBJECTIVE:a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle . 
SUBJECTIVE:gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western . 
SUBJECTIVE:in other words , it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon ! 
SUBJECTIVE:woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
SUBJECTIVE:the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
SUBJECTIVE:in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century . . . takes kurys' career to a whole new level . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying . 
SUBJECTIVE:beautifully acted , smart and funny . it steers clear of being a maudlin soap opera normally found on lifetime . 
SUBJECTIVE:in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little . 
SUBJECTIVE:a bit of whimsically warped history elevated by the central performance of ian holm . 
SUBJECTIVE:it is so refreshing to see robin williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he's been making for the last several years . 
SUBJECTIVE:a terrific insider look at the star-making machinery of tinseltown . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a celebration of self-confidence and a slap in the face of a society that cherises impossibly unnatural physical perfection . 
SUBJECTIVE:the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view . 
SUBJECTIVE:instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life . 
SUBJECTIVE:an absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss . 
SUBJECTIVE:a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal . 
SUBJECTIVE:the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers . 
SUBJECTIVE:a film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i saw the film . 
SUBJECTIVE:malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
SUBJECTIVE:one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 
SUBJECTIVE:a profoundly moving document . . . the filmmakers' refusal to downplay the situation's intractability makes the glimmer of hope the film offers that much more powerful . 
SUBJECTIVE:the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
SUBJECTIVE:a sparkling cosmopolitan comedy that plays fast and loose with sacred cows of family values . 
SUBJECTIVE:there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
SUBJECTIVE:an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it isn't . 
SUBJECTIVE:[city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year . 
SUBJECTIVE:not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions . 
SUBJECTIVE:if the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals , it nonetheless sustains interest during the long build-up of expository material . 
SUBJECTIVE:if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
SUBJECTIVE:it is a testament of quiet endurance , of common concern , of reconciled survival . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good . 
SUBJECTIVE:a tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled african-american's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle . 
SUBJECTIVE:i admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending . 
SUBJECTIVE:definitely not the knee-slapper that i was told it would be , but enough hahas for me to grade as passable . 
SUBJECTIVE:oliveira seems to pursue silent film representation with every mournful composition . 
SUBJECTIVE:for the most part , director anne-sophie birot's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama . 
SUBJECTIVE:the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . a vast adventure that bristles with romance , action and heroism . 
SUBJECTIVE:it was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo . 
SUBJECTIVE:one of the year's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
SUBJECTIVE:the trials of henry kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking … because you get it . 
SUBJECTIVE:an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions . 
SUBJECTIVE:a merciless thriller , threateningly beautiful to look at and eerie to behold . 
SUBJECTIVE:certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
SUBJECTIVE:this gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family . 
SUBJECTIVE:presents a most persuasive vision of hell on earth . 
SUBJECTIVE:no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . 
SUBJECTIVE:elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this . 
SUBJECTIVE:hoffman's performance is authentic to the core of his being . 
SUBJECTIVE:i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes . 
SUBJECTIVE:a quirky comedy set in newfoundland that cleverly captures the dry wit that's so prevalent on the rock . 
SUBJECTIVE:exploits [headbanger] stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter . 
SUBJECTIVE:a dizzying digital video oddyssey through the snowy woods of upstate new york . 
SUBJECTIVE:more than the last time around , it has elements that might help divert those bigger people who find themselves unavoidably in attendance . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes . . . drag the movie down . 
SUBJECTIVE:a biopic about crane's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video . 
SUBJECTIVE:like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
SUBJECTIVE: " the best disney movie since the lion king " 
SUBJECTIVE:the storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of gosford park have come to assume is just another day of brit cinema . 
SUBJECTIVE:uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity . 
SUBJECTIVE:a mess when it comes to the characters and writing . . . but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory . 
SUBJECTIVE:i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness . 
SUBJECTIVE:although mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel . 
SUBJECTIVE:the quirky and recessive charms of co-stars martin donovan and mary-louise parker help overcome the problematic script . 
SUBJECTIVE:the lively appeal of the last kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot . 
SUBJECTIVE:mature , graceful documentary on conservative christian parents with homosexual children . 
SUBJECTIVE:while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation . 
SUBJECTIVE:i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
SUBJECTIVE:the script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of 'hypertime' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for spy kids . 
SUBJECTIVE:the journey to the secret's eventual discovery is a separate adventure , and thrill enough . 
SUBJECTIVE:the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people . 
SUBJECTIVE:mcgrath has deftly trimmed dickens' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness . 
SUBJECTIVE:it would be a mistake to write this movie off as yet another star is born-type biopic about the rise and fall of a latter&#8209 ; day celebrity . schrader is after something deeper here and even when he misses the mark , the film remains involving . 
SUBJECTIVE:one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time . 
SUBJECTIVE:jones has crafted a natty narrative that , enhanced by erin nordstrom's editing , is filled with payoffs . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:smith's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes . 
SUBJECTIVE:the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . 
SUBJECTIVE:beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet 'evelyn . '
SUBJECTIVE:a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession – one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom . 
SUBJECTIVE:tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
SUBJECTIVE:russian ark moves beyond a simple technical exercise and into the realm of greatness . it's a masterpiece on every level . 
SUBJECTIVE:a coming-of-age film that avoids the cartoonish clichés and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type -- the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood . 
SUBJECTIVE:this humbling little film , fueled by the light comedic work of zhao benshan and the delicate ways of dong jie , is just the sort for those moviegoers who complain that 'they don't make movies like they used to anymore . '
SUBJECTIVE:a documentary to make the stones weep -- as shameful as it is scary . 
SUBJECTIVE:savvy director robert j . siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense . 
SUBJECTIVE:although olivier assayas' elegantly appointed period drama seems , at times , padded with incident in the way of a too-conscientious adaptation . . . its three-hour running time plays closer to two .

SUBJECTIVE: . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
SUBJECTIVE:without blowing the jokes we can say that , if you have found that your sense of humor fit well with christopher guest's screen outings , you'll find yourself in the flow with shearer as well . 
SUBJECTIVE:if oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but wasn't , guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . feels as if ( there's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 
SUBJECTIVE:has an impact that transcends politics and some dramatic overreaching by writer-director randall wallace . 
SUBJECTIVE:we just don't really care too much about this love story . in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting . 
SUBJECTIVE:it is just too bad the film's story does not live up to its style . 
SUBJECTIVE:a colorful , joyous celebration of life ; a tapestry woven of romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters . 
SUBJECTIVE:a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties . 
SUBJECTIVE:birot has succeeded in making a movie that has some laughs , low points and high ideals . 
SUBJECTIVE:writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call 'too clever by half . '
SUBJECTIVE:the film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . [the film] works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay . 
SUBJECTIVE:even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . 
SUBJECTIVE:nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it . i enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme . 
SUBJECTIVE:this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work . 
SUBJECTIVE:seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore . 
SUBJECTIVE:the most impressive quality of this charming movie is the way the characters , who are all recognizable 'types , ' refuse to behave the way we expect . 
SUBJECTIVE:even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it doesn't make for completely empty entertainment
SUBJECTIVE:i know that i'll never listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again
SUBJECTIVE:swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell . 
SUBJECTIVE:payami is to be applauded for taking biting potshots at such volatile issues as iran's outmoded electoral process and women's status as second-class citizens . 
SUBJECTIVE:hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty . 
SUBJECTIVE:a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack
SUBJECTIVE:often overwrought and at times positively irritating , the film turns into an engrossing thriller almost in spite of itself . 
SUBJECTIVE:sandler has played weirdos for zany comic effect , and it's interesting to finally see him play one in a relatively subdued romantic dramedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness . 
SUBJECTIVE:talky , artificial and opaque . . . an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture . 
SUBJECTIVE:suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative . still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed . 
SUBJECTIVE:it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 
SUBJECTIVE:a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises , read my lips is an original . this is a story of two misfits who don't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent . 
SUBJECTIVE:the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling . 
SUBJECTIVE:oliver parker brings the wit's [oscar wilde] work to the screen in a solidly rendered creation . 
SUBJECTIVE:it takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding . 
SUBJECTIVE:in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
SUBJECTIVE:a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards , 'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary . 
SUBJECTIVE:the best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and bertrand tavernier's oft-brilliant safe conduct ( " laissez-passer " ) wears its heart on its sleeve . 
SUBJECTIVE:the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield . 
SUBJECTIVE:it has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness . 
SUBJECTIVE:director of photography benoit delhomme shot the movie in delicious colors , and the costumes and sets are grand . 
SUBJECTIVE:a zippy , enormously entertaining heist movie that , with a kind heart at its core , encompasses the styles of yesterday , today , and if we're lucky , maybe even tomorrow . 
SUBJECTIVE:muccino is honest in the emotional damage left by his immature men and passionate in his portraits of twentysomething commitment-phobes struggling against growing up . 
SUBJECTIVE:you've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles , but it's worth yet another visit . 
SUBJECTIVE:with so many movies out there trying and failing to produce a single honest thrill , it's so nice to see one come along that's packed from start to finish with 'em . 
SUBJECTIVE:a powerful and telling story that examines forbidden love , racial tension , and other issues that are as valid today as they were in the 1950s .

SUBJECTIVE:ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna . 
SUBJECTIVE:often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part . 
SUBJECTIVE:bill morrison's decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful . 
SUBJECTIVE:the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 
SUBJECTIVE:may not be a breakthrough in filmmaking , but it is unwavering and arresting . 
SUBJECTIVE:charles' entertaining film chronicles seinfeld's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom , alongside wannabe comic adams' attempts to get his shot at the big time . 
SUBJECTIVE:that storytelling has value cannot be denied . not even solondz's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it . 
SUBJECTIVE:a worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions . 
SUBJECTIVE:a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned . if you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again . 
SUBJECTIVE:it is a timely film and a transporting one . 
SUBJECTIVE:highly irritating at first , mr . koury's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results . 
SUBJECTIVE:an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences . 
SUBJECTIVE:death to smoochy is often very funny , but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito's misanthropic vision . 
SUBJECTIVE:for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero . 
SUBJECTIVE:sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle . 
SUBJECTIVE:as comedic spotlights go , notorious c . h . o . hits all the verbal marks it should . 
SUBJECTIVE:tavernier shows us , in more ways than one , that le ciné ma de qualité lives on . 
SUBJECTIVE:it is a tough film to sit through , not out of any violence or perversion , but for its destitution . 
SUBJECTIVE:eventually moves and stirs you , even if it often resembles those steamy mexican tv dramas/soap operas called telenovelas . 
SUBJECTIVE:feardotcom's thrills are all cheap , but they mostly work . 
SUBJECTIVE:when a movie is as down-and-out funny as austin powers in goldmember , it's easy to overlook the missed opportunities and fizzled jokes littering the barrage of hilarity . 
SUBJECTIVE:the importance of being earnest resonates and inspires rapid-fire bouts of laughter , perhaps even a few giggles from the author himself , whom posterity has rewarded the last laugh . 
SUBJECTIVE:in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life . 
SUBJECTIVE:for decades we've marveled at disney's rendering of water , snow , flames and shadows in a hand-drawn animated world . prepare to marvel again . 
SUBJECTIVE:chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them . 
SUBJECTIVE:like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest . it can't escape its past , and it doesn't want to . 
SUBJECTIVE:city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite the film's shortcomings , it's still a solid effort and a thought-provoking look at idealism gone wrong . 
SUBJECTIVE:a slick , well-oiled machine , exquisitely polished and upholstered . 
SUBJECTIVE:plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
SUBJECTIVE:funny , somber , absurd , and , finally , achingly sad , bartleby is a fine , understated piece of filmmaking . 
SUBJECTIVE:an impressively coordinated enterprise that lasts three hours , manages a large cast , and covers a period of 30-odd years while successfully unfolding as a series of scenes from the life of a single character . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . 
SUBJECTIVE:obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's such a mechanical endeavor [that] it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .

SUBJECTIVE:the film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side . 
SUBJECTIVE:somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
SUBJECTIVE:romantic comedy and dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows , but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here . 
SUBJECTIVE:ice age won't drop your jaw , but it will warm your heart , and i'm giving it a strong thumbs up . 
SUBJECTIVE:forget other scary movies with freaky internet sites , dastardly murderers , ghosts on boats , spooky videotapes , they aren't half as scary as a gothic good old horror film about monsters that live under the bed
SUBJECTIVE:so earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script . 
SUBJECTIVE:amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community , one would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger , fatter heart than barbershop . 
SUBJECTIVE:the art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and kurys' direction is clever and insightful . 
SUBJECTIVE:the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it's offensive , but that it's boring . 
SUBJECTIVE:a film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers . 
SUBJECTIVE:not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches . 
SUBJECTIVE:notorious c . h . o . has oodles of vulgar highlights . 
SUBJECTIVE:with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path . 
SUBJECTIVE:the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long , you're desperate for the evening to end . 
SUBJECTIVE:the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 
SUBJECTIVE:not exactly worth a drum roll but a movie with enough collegiate ka-boom to earn its title , drumline is a percussion-driven musical variation on every sports pic you've seen about the talented hot dog who eventually learns to become a team player . 
SUBJECTIVE:though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is not a retread of " dead poets' society . " 
SUBJECTIVE:viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the stevenson's novel will likely prefer disney's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic . 
SUBJECTIVE:as expected , sayles' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever , though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances . 
SUBJECTIVE:static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year . 
SUBJECTIVE:offers a fascinating look into the world of upper-echelon comics . 
SUBJECTIVE:would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed 'the french lieutenant's woman . '
SUBJECTIVE:this movie in a single breath goes to the very heart of the russian experience . 
SUBJECTIVE:one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn . 
SUBJECTIVE:few films seem so wise and knowing about the fact of age and the approach of the end . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's unnerving to see recoing's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment . good film , but very glum . 
SUBJECTIVE:[soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 
SUBJECTIVE:vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them . 
SUBJECTIVE:that the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin's film serves up with style and empathy . 
SUBJECTIVE:offers 102 minutes of breezy , occasionally very funny entertainment . 
SUBJECTIVE:absurdities and clichés accumulate like lint in a fat man's navel . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it . 
SUBJECTIVE:a brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on hollywood , success , artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . although this idea is " new " the results are tired . 
SUBJECTIVE:one of the most incoherent features in recent memory . 
SUBJECTIVE:[javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama . 
SUBJECTIVE:a haunting film about one of the great escapes of all time . 
SUBJECTIVE:beautiful , angry and sad , with a curious sick poetry , as if the marquis de sade had gone in for pastel landscapes . 
SUBJECTIVE:it uses some of the figures from the real-life story to portray themselves in the film . the result is a powerful , naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking . 
SUBJECTIVE:asia authors herself as anna battista , an italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is way too full of itself ; it's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way . 
SUBJECTIVE:this remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise : al pacino loathing robin williams . 
SUBJECTIVE:can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . 
SUBJECTIVE:proves mainly that south korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their hollywood counterparts . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . 
SUBJECTIVE:comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . 
SUBJECTIVE:cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing . 
SUBJECTIVE:i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings . 
SUBJECTIVE:although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes . 
SUBJECTIVE:tsai ming-liang's ghosts are painfully aware of their not-being . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people . 
SUBJECTIVE:several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare . 
SUBJECTIVE:an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .

SUBJECTIVE:merchant effectively translates naipaul's lively mix of characters from the page to screen . 
SUBJECTIVE:much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date . 
SUBJECTIVE:an enjoyably half-wit remake of the venerable italian comedy big deal on madonna street . 
SUBJECTIVE:the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain . 
SUBJECTIVE:the script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul . . . he elevates the experience to a more mythic level . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commercialism . 
SUBJECTIVE:the powerless wait a long time for justice , and sometimes their only justice is to finally tell their story . 
SUBJECTIVE:hoffman's unfettered performance beautifully captures wilson's sad , manic quality . 
SUBJECTIVE:the skills of a calculus major at m . i . t . are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy who is cletis tout ? 
SUBJECTIVE:definitely funny stuff , but it's more of the 'laughing at' variety than the 'laughing with . '
SUBJECTIVE:imamura's delight in the infinite oddity of men and women is goofy ; it's also , at heart , reverent . 
SUBJECTIVE:one of [jaglom's] better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love . 
SUBJECTIVE:combines improbable melodrama ( gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas ) with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a fun movie with lots of colorful characters , lots of bizarre plot meanderings and quite a few memorable lines and sequences . 
SUBJECTIVE:a sugar-coated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks . 
SUBJECTIVE:it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy , the films of fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of goya . 
SUBJECTIVE:mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest the mummy returns . 
SUBJECTIVE:rock's got the kind of sly charm and non- self-conscious sincerity that could fit into any action hero archetype imaginable , even the old-school ones . 
SUBJECTIVE:like mike isn't interested in recycling old cliches . it wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor . 
SUBJECTIVE:the real reason to see runteldat is to watch lawrence deploy his deep and wide powers of empathy to depict such diverse experiences as childbirth , breast-feeding and recovering from illness . 
SUBJECTIVE:significant for the chilling moments when the children echo the very sentiments that continue to fuel the middle east conflict . 
SUBJECTIVE:the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . 
SUBJECTIVE:no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story . 
SUBJECTIVE:claude chabrol has here a thriller without thrills , but that's okay . 
SUBJECTIVE:even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment , spy kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man . 
SUBJECTIVE:terrific as nadia , a russian mail-order bride who comes to america speaking not a word of english , it's kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers . 
SUBJECTIVE:if reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show isn't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . 
SUBJECTIVE:even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp . 
SUBJECTIVE:windtalkers celebrates the human spirit and packs an emotional wallop . 
SUBJECTIVE:those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they don't really want to know . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's enough to watch huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that chabrol spins . 
SUBJECTIVE:provides an intriguing look at how the new economy has redrawn class lines in contemporary china . 
SUBJECTIVE:austin powers in goldmember is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride . 
SUBJECTIVE:what's the most positive thing that can be said about the new rob schneider vehicle ? well , it's not as pathetic as the animal . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor .

SUBJECTIVE:kids surely will like it . and for adults , it's perfectly watchable in a rugrats-y sort of way . 
SUBJECTIVE:a canny franchise escapade ; it gets the job done . 
SUBJECTIVE:bogdanovich taps deep into the hearst mystique , entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal . 
SUBJECTIVE:the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda . 
SUBJECTIVE:hardly a masterpiece , but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people . 
SUBJECTIVE:if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey doesn't really go anywhere . 
SUBJECTIVE:a hilarious film for anyone who remembers lying as a kid -- and anyone who wants to see a movie that's just plain fun . 
SUBJECTIVE:with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
SUBJECTIVE:while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it's far from being this generation's animal house . 
SUBJECTIVE:such a good-looking picture deserved to have more depth and unpredictability in its story . but it does stand out as a personal and unique entry in a time-worn genre , and that may be good enough . 
SUBJECTIVE:not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it . 
SUBJECTIVE:k-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories , but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of man confronting the demons of his own fear and paranoia . 
SUBJECTIVE:chilling in its objective portrait of dreary , lost twenty-first century america . 
SUBJECTIVE:a spiritual exploration of sorts , offering a message of hope that resonates . 
SUBJECTIVE:a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 
SUBJECTIVE:we started to wonder if … some unpaid intern had just typed 'chris rock , ' 'anthony hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some univac-like script machine . 
SUBJECTIVE:goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is a film living far too much in its own head . 
SUBJECTIVE:while the now 72-year-old robert evans been slowed down by a stroke , he has at least one more story to tell : his own . 
SUBJECTIVE:it has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you . . . 
SUBJECTIVE:a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship . 
SUBJECTIVE:[jaglom] creates an engaging insider's world of enthusiastically entertaining characters and absorbing situations . 
SUBJECTIVE:i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
SUBJECTIVE:short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight… tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . 
SUBJECTIVE:i can't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops . 
SUBJECTIVE:it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . 
SUBJECTIVE:the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows . 
SUBJECTIVE:the words , 'frankly , my dear , i don't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate . 
SUBJECTIVE:considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
SUBJECTIVE:well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . 
SUBJECTIVE:feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake . 
SUBJECTIVE:blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy . 
SUBJECTIVE:it all plays out . . . like a high-end john hughes comedy , a kind of elder bueller's time out . 
SUBJECTIVE:a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . 
SUBJECTIVE:for those in search of something different , wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale . 
SUBJECTIVE:raimi crafted a complicated hero who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is one of mr . chabrol's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny . 
SUBJECTIVE:because eight legged freaks is partly an homage to them , tarantula and other low- budget b-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly ( but not sophomoric ) romp through horror and hellish conditions . 
SUBJECTIVE:certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow , the weight of water is oppressively heavy . 
SUBJECTIVE:by turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy , never again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre . 
SUBJECTIVE:disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a great american adventure and a wonderful film to bring to imax . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . a b-movie-and-proud-of-it thrill ride , probably the best of its kind since tremors . 
SUBJECTIVE:the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed . 
SUBJECTIVE:bloody sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made . it's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing can't possibly be enough . 
SUBJECTIVE:son of the bride is slight fare , but it does have it poignancies , and it is well-acted and sweet without being cloying . 
SUBJECTIVE:the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque . 
SUBJECTIVE:a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women . 
SUBJECTIVE:neighbor's dog operates at a consistent chuckle pitch that frequently gives way to guffaws .

SUBJECTIVE:those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to ichi . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . only bond can save us from the latest eccentric , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction . 
SUBJECTIVE:a raw comedy that is intermittently hilarious as it attacks pretty much every taboo around . 
SUBJECTIVE:bursting through the constraints of its source , this is one adapted- from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen . 
SUBJECTIVE:scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped . 
SUBJECTIVE:audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching , but otherwise the production is suitably elegant . 
SUBJECTIVE:according to wendigo , 'nature' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves . 
SUBJECTIVE:the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 
SUBJECTIVE:a poignant and gently humorous parable that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end . 
SUBJECTIVE:haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed . 
SUBJECTIVE:a delicate balance of nostalgia and contemporary themes win out over scripting pregnant with cinematic schmaltz . 
SUBJECTIVE:proof that a newcomer indie filmmaker can infuse some new life into the downtrodden loser character study . 
SUBJECTIVE:curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary . 
SUBJECTIVE:even when he's not at his most critically insightful , godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work . 
SUBJECTIVE:sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance . 
SUBJECTIVE:the appearance of treebeard and gollum's expanded role will either have you loving what you're seeing , or rolling your eyes . i loved it ! gollum's 'performance' is incredible ! 
SUBJECTIVE:soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film . what's left is a rich stew of longing . 
SUBJECTIVE:a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture . 
SUBJECTIVE:director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . 
SUBJECTIVE:thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired . 
SUBJECTIVE:gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up . 
SUBJECTIVE:there are now two signs that m . night shyamalan's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : unbreakable and signs . 
SUBJECTIVE:others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that 'the urge to destroy is also a creative urge' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find morrison's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating . 
SUBJECTIVE:nemesis has a delightfully nasty villain and pumped-up action , albeit along familiar lines . 
SUBJECTIVE:a sweet , engaging family story about the nature of faith and the power of youthful innocence . 
SUBJECTIVE:it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff . 
SUBJECTIVE:yes , it's as good as you remember . in fact , even better . 
SUBJECTIVE:take a friend ( invisible or real ) to see this one . . . it's laugh out loud funny

SUBJECTIVE:a thoughtful , reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture , with its own rules regarding love and family , governance and hierarchy . 
SUBJECTIVE:well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special . 
SUBJECTIVE:graced with the kind of social texture and realism that would be foreign in american teen comedies . 
SUBJECTIVE:to be influenced chiefly by humanity's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for god's sake ! -- is a crime that should be punishable by chainsaw . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it's entertaining enough and worth a look . 
SUBJECTIVE:for all its bile and incoherence , in praise of love is filled with haunting images and insights . godard may be a lion in winter , but the lion still roars . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 
SUBJECTIVE:[it's] a clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest . 
SUBJECTIVE:lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . 
SUBJECTIVE:i can't imagine adaptation having much mainstream appeal , but , for those who look for something genuinely off-the-wall in a motion picture , this will unquestionably strike a nerve . 
SUBJECTIVE: . it's a testament to the film's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries . there's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls . . . 
SUBJECTIVE:a great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family . 
SUBJECTIVE:thirteen conversations about one thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began . 
SUBJECTIVE:instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources – good sources , bad mixture
SUBJECTIVE:although it tries to be much more , it's really just another major league . 
SUBJECTIVE:so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney won't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned . 
SUBJECTIVE:the director , mark pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head . 
SUBJECTIVE:another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through . 
SUBJECTIVE:contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is almost eerily calm and refuses to take sides . but that lets its insights penetrate all the deeper . 
SUBJECTIVE:an endlessly fascinating , landmark movie that is as bold as anything the cinema has seen in years . 
SUBJECTIVE:this isn't a good movie ; this isn't a bad movie . this is a movie that dispenses with the whole good/bad paradigm and exists on its own plane of reality . 
SUBJECTIVE:everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and if it isn't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers . 
SUBJECTIVE:an interesting , if not entirely successful , biography of two extraordinary personalities . 
SUBJECTIVE:`martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .

SUBJECTIVE:the film is a verbal duel between two gifted performers . 
SUBJECTIVE:almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences . 
SUBJECTIVE:vincent gallo is right at home in this french shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role . 
SUBJECTIVE:an overly melodramatic but somewhat insightful french coming-of-age film . . . 
SUBJECTIVE:about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time . 
SUBJECTIVE:saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is as respectful a film as byatt fans could hope for , though lovers of the book may wonder why it's necessary . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's rare to find a film to which the adjective 'gentle' applies , but the word perfectly describes pauline & paulette . 
SUBJECTIVE:a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches . 
SUBJECTIVE:shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski's the pianist , but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high . 
SUBJECTIVE:though it's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to leigh for actually casting people who look working-class . 
SUBJECTIVE:this thing works on no level whatsoever for me . 
SUBJECTIVE:a working class " us vs . them " opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you're the kind of parent who enjoys intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix , i have just one word for you -– decasia
SUBJECTIVE:pipe dream does have its charms . the leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly . 
SUBJECTIVE:a photographic marvel of sorts , and it's certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community . 
SUBJECTIVE:after an uncertain start , murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with bullock's memorable first interrogation of gosling . 
SUBJECTIVE:the trick when watching godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them .

SUBJECTIVE:boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas . 
SUBJECTIVE:[reno] may have a few grating gaps in logic and feels as if a good chunk of its story ended up on the cutting room floor , but there is just enough charm and humor peppered throughout to make it feel as if it wasn't a complete waste of time to sit through . 
SUBJECTIVE:elegantly produced and expressively performed , the six musical numbers crystallize key plot moments into minutely detailed wonders of dreamlike ecstasy . 
SUBJECTIVE:little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick . 
SUBJECTIVE:soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology , either liberal or conservative . mr . scorsese's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated . 
SUBJECTIVE:absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way . 
SUBJECTIVE:sunshine state is sayles at his most robert altman-ish , purposefully juggling about a dozen narrative balls in the air , and letting the mundanity and smallish drama of everyday life tell a larger story . 
SUBJECTIVE:this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows . 
SUBJECTIVE:a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
SUBJECTIVE:mostly honest , this somber picture reveals itself slowly , intelligently , artfully . 
SUBJECTIVE:a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely cannot last . 
SUBJECTIVE:the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more . 
SUBJECTIVE:you're not merely watching history , you're engulfed by it . 
SUBJECTIVE:unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers . 
SUBJECTIVE:it may sound like a mere disease-of- the-week tv movie , but a song for martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real-life spouses seldahl and wollter . 
SUBJECTIVE:a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one . 
SUBJECTIVE:a recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard's pyromania . 
SUBJECTIVE:both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they're each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll . 
SUBJECTIVE:ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis . 
SUBJECTIVE:the locale . . . remains far more interesting than the story at hand . 
SUBJECTIVE:pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal . 
SUBJECTIVE:brings a rare , clinically specific sense of moral complexity and humanistic sympathy to the usual regimen of finger-pointing and exposure . 
SUBJECTIVE:now as a former gong show addict , i'll admit it , my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show . 
SUBJECTIVE:your stomach for heaven depends largely on your appetite for canned corn . 
SUBJECTIVE:the talents of the actors helps " moonlight mile " rise above its heart-on-its-sleeve writing . 
SUBJECTIVE:some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments . 
SUBJECTIVE:like shrek , spirit's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world . 
SUBJECTIVE:colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory . 
SUBJECTIVE:nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release . 
SUBJECTIVE:just isn't as weird as it ought to be . 
SUBJECTIVE:by candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , [jones] calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity . 
SUBJECTIVE:this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . there can be no other explanation . hilariously inept and ridiculous . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland . 
SUBJECTIVE:moretti . . . is the rare common-man artist who's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is snappy , frothy screwball comedy awash in french understatement . 
SUBJECTIVE:seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one . 
SUBJECTIVE:i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
SUBJECTIVE:beautifully written and directed and packed with excellent performances . 
SUBJECTIVE:whether seen on a 10-inch television screen or at your local multiplex , the edge-of-your-seat , educational antics of steve irwin are priceless entertainment . 
SUBJECTIVE:this may not be great moviemaking . . . but it's vastly enjoyable in a low-down , scandal-mongering way . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is almodovar's stab at serious drama , and the result is bizarre and affecting but also unsettling in ways that the filmmaker may not have intended . 
SUBJECTIVE:thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters . mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way . 
SUBJECTIVE:the storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome . 
SUBJECTIVE:a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick . 
SUBJECTIVE:director robert rodriguez has once again caught lightning in a bottle . 
SUBJECTIVE:try as you might to resist , if you've got a place in your heart for smokey robinson , this movie will worm its way there . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie . . . that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups . 
SUBJECTIVE:some remarkable achival film about how shanghai ( of all places ) served jews who escaped the holocaust . 
SUBJECTIVE:an entertaining but unspectacular film . pretty goofy at times - but the slick and gleefully self-indulgent violence will not disappoint the action fan . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . could easily be called the best korean film of 2002 . 
SUBJECTIVE:while the finished product is still fun , never dull and the athletes themselves remarkable , inspired and apt , the production could have been improved . 
SUBJECTIVE:there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
SUBJECTIVE:at once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future . 
SUBJECTIVE:a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you're going to alter the bard's ending , you'd better have a good alternative . 
SUBJECTIVE:broomfield reveals an ironic manifestation of institutionalized slavery that ties a black-owned record label with a white-empowered police force . 
SUBJECTIVE:on balance , i recommend the movie both for nicholson's performance and for the opportunity to spend some time with the kind of man that we often meet in real life , but rarely see on screen . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you keep a list of films you want to see one way or another , you would be doing yourself a service by keeping this film high up on that list . 
SUBJECTIVE:it doesn't do a lot of deep thinking , but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x , it does make a statement : freedom of opinion is a threat to totalitarian systems . 
SUBJECTIVE:like edward norton in american history x , ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) delivers a magnetic performance . 
SUBJECTIVE:nair's attention to detail creates an impeccable sense of place , while thurman and lewis give what can easily be considered career-best performances . 
SUBJECTIVE:the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few . 
SUBJECTIVE:pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion . 
SUBJECTIVE:the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second .

SUBJECTIVE:reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish . 
SUBJECTIVE:lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else . 
SUBJECTIVE:an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 
SUBJECTIVE:you know you're in for a good ol' popcorn-munching time when the movie's tagline is a bad pun on the title of a piece of fine literature .

SUBJECTIVE:film can't quite maintain its initial momentum , but remains sporadically funny throughout . 
SUBJECTIVE:the soundtrack alone -- the literal pulse of the thing -- will rock you in your seat . 
SUBJECTIVE:the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . 
SUBJECTIVE:while the film really doesn't have anything new to say , it's still thoughtful and well-crafted . 
SUBJECTIVE:moore's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that's still very much playing itself out .

SUBJECTIVE:as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner .

SUBJECTIVE:the touch is generally light enough and the performances , for the most part , credible .

SUBJECTIVE:chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial . 
SUBJECTIVE:all in all , it's a pretty good execution of a story that's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own . 
SUBJECTIVE:consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .

SUBJECTIVE:without [de niro] , city by the sea would slip under the waves . he drags it back , single-handed . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . the first 2/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor . . .

SUBJECTIVE:the pitch must have read like a discarded house beautiful spread . 
SUBJECTIVE:the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada .

SUBJECTIVE:a whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking christian-themed fun . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's slow -- very , very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype . 
SUBJECTIVE:done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment . 
SUBJECTIVE:this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:far from heaven is a dazzling conceptual feat , but more than that , it's a work of enthralling drama . 
SUBJECTIVE:not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired . 
SUBJECTIVE:less cinematically powerful than quietly and deeply moving , which is powerful in itself . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
SUBJECTIVE:even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat .

SUBJECTIVE:one of the most splendid entertainments to emerge from the french film industry in years . 
SUBJECTIVE:serry perfectly captures the peculiar climate , creating uncanny echoes with today's situation . 
SUBJECTIVE:unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted . 
SUBJECTIVE:it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty .

SUBJECTIVE:none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest . 
SUBJECTIVE:the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin couldn't keep my attention . 
SUBJECTIVE:rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle
SUBJECTIVE:the heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in [this] meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot . 
SUBJECTIVE:like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's none of the happily-ever -after spangle of monsoon wedding in late marriage -- and that's part of what makes dover kosashvili's outstanding feature debut so potent . 
SUBJECTIVE:ain't no mountain high enough to keep the funk brothers from getting to you . 
SUBJECTIVE:on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , the powerpuff girls is a fast , frenetic , funny , even punny 6 -- aimed specifically at a grade-school audience .

SUBJECTIVE:it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot . 
SUBJECTIVE:i still can't relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough . 
SUBJECTIVE:miyazaki has provided another triumph , and , in the midst of the quality fall-off of disney's in-house animated projects , a reason for animation-lovers to rejoice . 
SUBJECTIVE:five screenwriters are credited with the cliché-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before . 
SUBJECTIVE:feels a little too carefully crafted to be absolutely truthful , but nonetheless yields rich food for thought about the pains of the creative process and the insecurities of the artistic temperament . 
SUBJECTIVE:the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience . 
SUBJECTIVE:it certainly won't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time . 
SUBJECTIVE:has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act .

SUBJECTIVE:there is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us . 
SUBJECTIVE:massoud's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner ( and ultimately the victim ) of history . 
SUBJECTIVE:not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were .

SUBJECTIVE:an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .

SUBJECTIVE:guzman's powerful and sometimes triumphant documentary is not only an excellent overview of the affair , but serves as the perfect finale to the monumental trilogy about the coup and its aftermath . 
SUBJECTIVE:each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
SUBJECTIVE:an affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer's previous collaboration , miss congeniality .

SUBJECTIVE:works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged .

SUBJECTIVE:the filmmakers wisely decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him . 
SUBJECTIVE:[cuarón has] created a substantive movie out of several cliched movie structures : the road movie , the coming-of-age movie , and the teenage sex comedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:when mr . hundert tells us in his narration that 'this is a story without surprises , ' we nod in agreement . 
SUBJECTIVE:content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 
SUBJECTIVE:the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters . 
SUBJECTIVE:even though the film runs a brief 71 minutes -- finishing off with footage of reno talking with new yorkers on the street in the aftermath of 9/11 -- reno shows enough gusto to make you a fan . 
SUBJECTIVE:[seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 
SUBJECTIVE:there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .

SUBJECTIVE:seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof .

SUBJECTIVE:the weird thing about the santa clause 2 , purportedly a children's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally .

SUBJECTIVE:pete's screenplay manages to find that real natural , even-flowing tone that few movies are able to accomplish . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . think of it as american pie on valium . 
SUBJECTIVE:the emperor's club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but . . . 
SUBJECTIVE:when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks . 
SUBJECTIVE:though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted . 
SUBJECTIVE:at 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth . 
SUBJECTIVE:sparkles in its deft portrait of tinseltown's seasoned veterans of gossip , wealth , paranoia , and celebrityhood . 
SUBJECTIVE:the filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching . 
SUBJECTIVE:shiner can certainly go the distance , but isn't world championship material
SUBJECTIVE:despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this .

SUBJECTIVE:ferrara directs the entire film with the kind of detachment that makes any given frame look like a family's custom-made christmas card . 
SUBJECTIVE:a flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds . 
SUBJECTIVE:with the exception of mccoist , the players don't have a clue on the park . the acting isn't much better . 
SUBJECTIVE:miyazaki's nonstop images are so stunning , and his imagination so vivid , that the only possible complaint you could have about spirited away is that there is no rest period , no timeout . 
SUBJECTIVE:solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
SUBJECTIVE:the filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they won't much care about . 
SUBJECTIVE:french director helene angel's dark but deftly handled fable about familial violence has a terrifying , fairy-tale atmosphere that's in perfect keeping with its unique point of view . 
SUBJECTIVE:[t]his beguiling belgian fable , very much its own droll and delicate little film , has some touching things to say about what is important in life and why . 
SUBJECTIVE:the cast is top-notch and i predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over michael idemoto as michael . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle . 
SUBJECTIVE:my big fat greek wedding is that rare animal known as 'a perfect family film , ' because it's about family . 
SUBJECTIVE:vega and ulloa give strong performances as the leading lovers and there are some strong supporting turns , particularly from najwa nimri . 
SUBJECTIVE:call it magic realism or surrealism , but miss wonton floats beyond reality with a certain degree of wit and dignity .

SUBJECTIVE:on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation . 
SUBJECTIVE:planet is as much sheer fun as its source material .

SUBJECTIVE:there's . . . tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate . 
SUBJECTIVE:though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static . 
SUBJECTIVE:enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment . 
SUBJECTIVE:ms . rampling , still beautiful well into her 50s , has an earth-bound weariness and lively spirit that convey a life fully and tragically lived . 
SUBJECTIVE:a gem of a romantic crime comedy that turns out to be clever , amusing and unpredictable . 
SUBJECTIVE:how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?

SUBJECTIVE:while most films these days are about nothing , this film seems to be about everything that's plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world .

SUBJECTIVE:an odd drama set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the midwest that held my interest precisely because it didn't try to . 
SUBJECTIVE:this cheery , down-to-earth film is warm with the cozy feeling of relaxing around old friends . 
SUBJECTIVE:while peterson and her ageless alter ego keep an ironic detachment from the melodramatics , there's no irony in the end-title dedication to price -- it obviously comes straight from the heart . 
SUBJECTIVE:all right , so it's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast . 
SUBJECTIVE:a by-the-numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
SUBJECTIVE:i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort .

SUBJECTIVE:the kind of film that grows on you upon reflection
SUBJECTIVE:[hayek] doesn't just act frida , she inhabits her .

SUBJECTIVE:overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste .

SUBJECTIVE:payne constructs a hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey , featuring a pathetic , endearing hero who is all too human . 
SUBJECTIVE:the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace .

SUBJECTIVE:when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .

SUBJECTIVE:the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments . 
SUBJECTIVE:astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . 
SUBJECTIVE:with an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , everett remains a perfect wildean actor , and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill .

SUBJECTIVE:does a good job of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character's story .

SUBJECTIVE:nearly 75 years after the fact , the matter still hasn't given up all its secrets , but denis' film comes close to a definitive , deeply disturbing account . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .

SUBJECTIVE:a must see for all sides of the political spectrum
SUBJECTIVE:although estela bravo's documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of cuban leader fidel castro , it's still a guilty pleasure to watch .

SUBJECTIVE:an incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks .

SUBJECTIVE:an amusing , even joyful second take on e . b . white's beloved children's book .

SUBJECTIVE:a collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films . 
SUBJECTIVE:somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life . 
SUBJECTIVE:in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .

SUBJECTIVE:as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on .

SUBJECTIVE:visits spy-movie territory like a novel you can't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last .

SUBJECTIVE:the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .

SUBJECTIVE:[o]ften a capable documentary on an interesting subject , even if it doesn't probe as deeply as it could .

SUBJECTIVE:the project honors [dickens'] passionate voice , and the strong ensemble cast sees us through a few tonal shifts . 
SUBJECTIVE:fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's still a comic book , but maguire makes it a comic book with soul . 
SUBJECTIVE:an inventive , absorbing movie that's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .

SUBJECTIVE:the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) . 
SUBJECTIVE:by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what's possible and what we might do to make it so . 
SUBJECTIVE:even if you don't think [kissinger's] any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . has a bit more going for it than just bikini babes and bitchin' waves . but the plot is ankle deep at best .

SUBJECTIVE:it's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful .

SUBJECTIVE:medem packs it with so much stunning , wildly colorful imagery -- and so much sex -- that it transfixes you even when you're not quite sure what's going on . 
SUBJECTIVE:highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role .

SUBJECTIVE:schefberg has the courage to make the story messily un-formulaic . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go . 
SUBJECTIVE:ofrece una buena oportunidad de cultura ( aunque sea condensada ) que bien vale la pena aprovechar . 
SUBJECTIVE:i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example . 
SUBJECTIVE:even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon . 
SUBJECTIVE:wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time . 
SUBJECTIVE:[næs] directed the stage version of elling , and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage .

SUBJECTIVE:a subtle , poignant picture of goodness that is flawed , compromised and sad . 
SUBJECTIVE:no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story . 
SUBJECTIVE:maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul " full frontal " seems , well , contrived . 
SUBJECTIVE:a different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of world war ii through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man lost in its midst . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is human comedy at its most amusing , interesting and confirming . 
SUBJECTIVE:this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 
SUBJECTIVE:a real step forward for the digital video revolution . 
SUBJECTIVE:more of the same from taiwanese auteur tsai ming-liang , which is good news to anyone who's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director's previous films . 
SUBJECTIVE:an extraordinary swedish film about the soul adventure of marriage -- the kind of intimate and character-driven film that bille august does best . 
SUBJECTIVE:just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence . . . lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm . 
SUBJECTIVE:kissing jessica stein is your standard romantic comedy , only better : twice the chicks and half the guys . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
SUBJECTIVE:hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is as lax and limp a comedy as i've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material . 
SUBJECTIVE:has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a subtle mood piece in which a man's collapse is examined so rigorously that one almost hopes for a murder to come along and break the tension . 
SUBJECTIVE:first-time writer-director serry shows a remarkable gift for storytelling with this moving , effective little film . 
SUBJECTIVE:the acting is just fine , but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff . 
SUBJECTIVE:cassavetes thinks he's making dog day afternoon with a cause , but all he's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon . 
SUBJECTIVE:after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying .

SUBJECTIVE:the funny thing is , i didn't mind all this contrived nonsense a bit . 
SUBJECTIVE:[green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you've seen the remake first . many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , [yet] are worthwhile . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite cramming in numerous clichés , mehta still manages to put a fresh and funny spin on the proceedings . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . 
SUBJECTIVE:skin of man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics , but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults . 
SUBJECTIVE:although the level of the comedy declines as the movie proceeds , there's no denying the fun of watching de niro and crystal having fun . 
SUBJECTIVE:an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be . 
SUBJECTIVE:borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion . 
SUBJECTIVE:when the movie mixes the cornpone and the cosa nostra , it finds a nice rhythm . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you love the music , and i do , its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary . . . 
SUBJECTIVE:hollywood ending is not show-stoppingly hilarious , but scathingly witty nonetheless . 
SUBJECTIVE:no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it . 
SUBJECTIVE:none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter . 
SUBJECTIVE:by turns whimsical and absurdist , babek payami's secret ballot is a slight but likable iranian film with the flavor of a shaggy-dog story conceived by samuel beckett and directed by jim jarmusch . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you're not the target demographic . . . this movie is one long chick-flick slog . 
SUBJECTIVE:vividly conveys the shadow side of the 30-year friendship between two english women . 
SUBJECTIVE:would be an unendurable viewing experience for this ultra-provincial new yorker if 26-year-old reese witherspoon were not on hand to inject her pure fantasy character , melanie carmichael , with a massive infusion of old-fashioned hollywood magic . 
SUBJECTIVE:although sensitive to a fault , it's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken . 
SUBJECTIVE:a fascinating , unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man . 
SUBJECTIVE:it irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2 , 500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance
SUBJECTIVE: . . . best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the warren report . 
SUBJECTIVE:what's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors . 
SUBJECTIVE:francophiles will snicker knowingly and you'll want to slap them . 
SUBJECTIVE:tony gayton's script doesn't give us anything we haven't seen before , but director d . j . caruso's grimy visual veneer and kilmer's absorbing performance increase the gravitational pull considerably . 
SUBJECTIVE:sandler , in trusting his director , gives a performance that declares the star a genuinely fine actor . 
SUBJECTIVE:they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
SUBJECTIVE:they threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans . 
SUBJECTIVE:kiarostami has crafted a deceptively casual ode to children and managed to convey a tiny sense of hope . 
SUBJECTIVE:as if trying to grab a lump of play-doh , the harder that liman tries to squeeze his story , the more details slip out between his fingers . 
SUBJECTIVE:having had the good sense to cast actors who are , generally speaking , adored by the movie-going public , khouri then gets terrific performances from them all . 
SUBJECTIVE:my oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism . 
SUBJECTIVE:fontaine indulges her signature style , creating a carefully measured film -- the kind whose impact slowly sneaks up on its audience and haunts them long after leaving the theatre . 
SUBJECTIVE:from spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , vincent's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of jean renoir . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . 
SUBJECTIVE:there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements don't gel . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . a fairly disposable yet still entertaining b picture . 
SUBJECTIVE:one can't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney's latest album . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's not particularly subtle . . . however , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion . 
SUBJECTIVE:photographed with melancholy richness and eloquently performed yet also decidedly uncinematic . 
SUBJECTIVE:does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ?

SUBJECTIVE:watching e . t now , in an era dominated by cold , loud special-effects-laden extravaganzas , one is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision . 
SUBJECTIVE:borstal boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy . 
SUBJECTIVE:lee's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability . 
SUBJECTIVE:[aniston is] so good , she manages to overcome the occasional nuggets of preciousness and self-consciousness in the story . 
SUBJECTIVE:attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is a rare twisted crowd-pleaser for longtime fans as well as novices -- or for those that don't know an arachnid from an insect . 
SUBJECTIVE: in its own remarkable and unshowy way , this movie is truly about how sept . 11 seemed to equalize and unite new yorkers across imaginary barriers of class and lifestyle . 
SUBJECTIVE:a movie that can't get sufficient distance from leroy's delusions to escape their maudlin influence . 
SUBJECTIVE:the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in [the characters'] misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch christian right propaganda machine into national media circles . 
SUBJECTIVE:an excellent date movie , because you and your date will likely be clinging on to each other within 10 minutes . 
SUBJECTIVE:a historical epic with the courage of its convictions about both scope and detail . 
SUBJECTIVE:miller comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary . 
SUBJECTIVE:not too far below the gloss you can still feel director denis villeneuve's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters .

SUBJECTIVE:a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:ice cube holds the film together with an engaging and warm performance . . . 
SUBJECTIVE:there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 
SUBJECTIVE:watching living actors interact against the lush , studied inertia of the backdrops gives us the impression of history come to life , or statues magically transformed into living creatures . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : " got aids yet ? "

SUBJECTIVE:has the rare capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke . 
SUBJECTIVE:although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 
SUBJECTIVE:ramsay is clearly extraordinarily talented , and based on three short films and two features , here's betting her third feature will be something to behold .

SUBJECTIVE:handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism .

SUBJECTIVE:essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
SUBJECTIVE:if the very concept makes you nervous . . . you'll have an idea of the film's creepy , scary effectiveness . 
SUBJECTIVE:the first half is a hilariously on-target send-up of " barbarella " -style flicks and the larger-than-life egos that propelled them , the second half is a ponderously self-absorbed meditation on the angst of a budding artiste . 
SUBJECTIVE:the longer version may be truer to tornatore's tripartite vision--and less simply cloying and calculated--but ultimately it's also less coherent and emotionally satisfying . 
SUBJECTIVE:'cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about

SUBJECTIVE:an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow .

SUBJECTIVE:as the empire strikes back was to star wars , so harry potter and the chamber of secrets is to last year's freshman introduction . in short , it's bigger and better . 
SUBJECTIVE:not for the prurient or squeamish , it's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics .

SUBJECTIVE:talk to her is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be , but it's still quite worth seeing . 
SUBJECTIVE:this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
SUBJECTIVE:sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it . 
SUBJECTIVE:though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore . 
SUBJECTIVE:read my lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love .

SUBJECTIVE:there is a real subject here , and it is handled with intelligence and care .

SUBJECTIVE:rarely does such high-profile talent serve such literate material .

SUBJECTIVE:it manages to squeeze by on angelina jolie's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:what the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion , as corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is like sitting in a downtown café , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is an action movie with an action icon who's been all but decommissioned . 
SUBJECTIVE:this may be burns's strongest film since the brothers mcmullen . 
SUBJECTIVE:feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 
SUBJECTIVE:turns out to be a nifty swashbuckler whose plot easily could have been lifted from a number of douglas fairbanks silent pictures .

SUBJECTIVE:you can sip your vintage wines and watch your merchant ivory productions ; i'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a jerry bruckheimer flick any day of the week .

SUBJECTIVE:despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
SUBJECTIVE:a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido . 
SUBJECTIVE:payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast . 
SUBJECTIVE:as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma . 
SUBJECTIVE:the color sense of stuart little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie weren't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is . 
SUBJECTIVE:bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless . indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions . 
SUBJECTIVE:the only question . . . is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . average , at best , i'm afraid .

SUBJECTIVE:though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . 
SUBJECTIVE:the scorpion king is more fun than conan the barbarian . 
SUBJECTIVE:more of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller .

SUBJECTIVE:the imax screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more . 
SUBJECTIVE:red dragon is less baroque and showy than hannibal , and less emotionally affecting than silence . but , like silence , it's a movie that gets under your skin .

SUBJECTIVE:a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial . 
SUBJECTIVE:if [jaglom's] latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling , some of its repartee is still worth hearing . 
SUBJECTIVE:not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time .

SUBJECTIVE:it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .

SUBJECTIVE:by the time its otherwise paint-by-numbers story reaches a finale , drumline has made band seem cool -- no small feat in the wake of american pie 2 .

SUBJECTIVE:while tattoo borrows heavily from both seven and the silence of the lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in .

SUBJECTIVE:it's not going to be everyone's bag of popcorn , but it definitely gives you something to chew on . 
SUBJECTIVE:shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .

SUBJECTIVE:before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg's adaptation of mary gaitskill's harrowing short story . . . is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience . 
SUBJECTIVE:a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice's second installment of her vampire chronicles . 
SUBJECTIVE:about schmidt is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year . if you're not deeply touched by this movie , check your pulse . 
SUBJECTIVE:perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .

SUBJECTIVE:there's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects . 
SUBJECTIVE:proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:by taking entertainment tonight subject matter and giving it humor and poignancy , auto focus becomes both gut-bustingly funny and crushingly depressing .

SUBJECTIVE:a charming , vibrant , if under-edited adaptation of v . s . naipaul's genially cynical novel .

SUBJECTIVE:the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder .

SUBJECTIVE:it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
SUBJECTIVE:a beautiful , entertaining two hours . you get the idea , though , that kapur intended the film to be more than that . 
SUBJECTIVE:a beautifully tooled action thriller about love and terrorism in korea .

SUBJECTIVE:if you like your comedy dark and slightly freaky , then steve shainberg's film deserves your attention .

SUBJECTIVE:the hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment . 
SUBJECTIVE:an enchanting film that presents an audacious tour of the past and takes within its warm embrace the bounties of cultural artifacts inside st . petersburg's hermitage museum . 
SUBJECTIVE:after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget . 
SUBJECTIVE:a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . 
SUBJECTIVE:the result puts a human face on derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally couldn't care less .

SUBJECTIVE:weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie doesn't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us . 
SUBJECTIVE:the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious . 
SUBJECTIVE:perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
SUBJECTIVE:several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante . 
SUBJECTIVE:what a concept , what an idea , what a thrill ride . this is a more fascinating look at the future than " bladerunner " and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness . 
SUBJECTIVE:truth is stranger than fiction , so the old saying goes . in 'catch me if you can , ' it's also more entertaining . 
SUBJECTIVE:what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature . 
SUBJECTIVE:in his latest effort , storytelling , solondz has finally made a movie that isn't just offensive -- it also happens to be good . 
SUBJECTIVE:very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
SUBJECTIVE:at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii . 
SUBJECTIVE:light years/ several warp speeds/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful insurrection . which isn't to say that it's the equal of some of its predecessors . 
SUBJECTIVE:not a bad way to spend a couple of hours . 
SUBJECTIVE:a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
SUBJECTIVE:a compassionate , moving portrait of an american ( and an america ) always reaching for something just outside his grasp . 
SUBJECTIVE:belongs to daniel day-lewis as much as it belongs to martin scorsese ; it's a memorable performance in a big , brassy , disturbing , unusual and highly successful film . 
SUBJECTIVE: ( e . t . ) stands as a perfect movie-going experience that i don't believe will ever show signs of age . 
SUBJECTIVE:cockettes has the glorious , gaudy benefit of much stock footage of those days , featuring all manner of drag queen , bearded lady and lactating hippie . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . 
SUBJECTIVE:sweet home alabama certainly won't be remembered as one of [witherspoon's] better films . 
SUBJECTIVE:dense and enigmatic . . . elusive . . . stagy and stilted
SUBJECTIVE:depressive , slow , darkly funny , unyielding in its formal rigor , and unsettlingly beautiful . 
SUBJECTIVE:[haynes'] homage to such films as " all that heaven allows " and " imitation of life " transcends them . simply put , " far from heaven " is a masterpiece . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best 'old neighborhood' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists . 
SUBJECTIVE:in the affable maid in manhattan , jennifer lopez's most aggressive and most sincere attempt to take movies by storm , the diva shrewdly surrounds herself with a company of strictly a-list players . 
SUBJECTIVE:i'm going to give it a marginal thumbs up . i liked it just enough . 
SUBJECTIVE:the kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati . 
SUBJECTIVE:a stunning piece of visual poetry that will , hopefully , be remembered as one of the most important stories to be told in australia's film history . 
SUBJECTIVE:a coming-of-age tale from new zealand whose boozy , languid air is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply felt performances across the board . 
SUBJECTIVE:muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they don't have , and how this gets us in trouble . but even while his characters are acting horribly , he is always sympathetic . 
SUBJECTIVE:worth seeing once , but its charm quickly fades . 
SUBJECTIVE:…it wasn't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film…it was the unfulfilling , incongruous , " wait a second , did i miss something ? " ending . 
SUBJECTIVE: " the emperor's new clothes " begins with a simple plan . . . . well , at least that's the plan . 
SUBJECTIVE:we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor . 
SUBJECTIVE:[kidd] can write dialogue , work skillfully with actors , and he has a pretty good handle on urban loneliness of the knowing , virulent new york city variety . 
SUBJECTIVE:charlotte sometimes is a brilliant movie . it is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown chelsea hotel . . . 
SUBJECTIVE:as a film director , labute continues to improve . 
SUBJECTIVE:a gorgeous , high-spirited musical from india that exquisitely blends music , dance , song , and high drama . 
SUBJECTIVE:the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
SUBJECTIVE:the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept . 
SUBJECTIVE:angel presents events partly from the perspective of aurelie and christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale . 
SUBJECTIVE:what's infuriating about full frontal is that it's too close to real life to make sense . what's invigorating about it is that it doesn't give a damn . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . 
SUBJECTIVE:on a purely pictorial level , this is one of the best-looking imax movies ever . 
SUBJECTIVE:lejos del paraíso es al mismo tiempo una fiesta para los ojos y oídos y un movilizador cuadro de personajes enfrentados a sus propios deseos , miedos y prejuicios . 
SUBJECTIVE:gets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film's snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone . 
SUBJECTIVE:hey , happy ! is great for stoners , queens , ravers and , yes , parties . 
SUBJECTIVE:the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing . 
SUBJECTIVE:an ideal love story for those intolerant of the more common saccharine genre . 
SUBJECTIVE:this follow-up boasts most of the felicities of the original . 
SUBJECTIVE:the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 
SUBJECTIVE:third time's the charm . . . yeah , baby ! 
SUBJECTIVE:an often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy . 
SUBJECTIVE:by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , . . . actually pretty good . of course , by more objective measurements it's still quite bad . 
SUBJECTIVE:maybe it is formula filmmaking , but there's nothing wrong with that if the film is well-crafted and this one is . 
SUBJECTIVE:it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 
SUBJECTIVE:you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . 
SUBJECTIVE:adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
SUBJECTIVE:in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz . 
SUBJECTIVE:suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . 
SUBJECTIVE:on the surface a silly comedy , scotland , pa would be forgettable if it weren't such a clever adaptation of the bard's tragic play . 
SUBJECTIVE:comes off like a bad imitation of the bard . 
SUBJECTIVE:writer/director burr steers emphasizes the q in quirky , with mixed results . 
SUBJECTIVE:tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 
SUBJECTIVE:for all its brooding quality , ash wednesday is suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable , with a sterling ensemble cast . 
SUBJECTIVE:nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
SUBJECTIVE:like most of godard's films , in praise of love makes you stay awake and lean forward . 
SUBJECTIVE: " mr . deeds " is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought . 
SUBJECTIVE:it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either . 
SUBJECTIVE:hard , endearing , caring , warm . bring tissues . 
SUBJECTIVE:writer/director burr steers knows how to show irony , the trouble with kids , and new yorkers taking casual sex for granted . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's the extra layer that makes this one , the movie's understanding of how disillusion and inner compromise can gradually separate a young artist from his divine spark . 
SUBJECTIVE:finds a way to tell a simple story , perhaps the simplest story of all , in a way that seems compelling and even original . 
SUBJECTIVE:you might not buy the ideas . but you'll definitely want the t-shirt . 
SUBJECTIVE:director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is saved from aren't-kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that isn't faked and a stately sense of composition . 
SUBJECTIVE:like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well . 
SUBJECTIVE:entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately . . . dare i say , entertaining ! 
SUBJECTIVE:provides a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views . 
SUBJECTIVE:the events of the film are just so weird that i honestly never knew what the hell was coming next . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film sometimes flags . . . but there is enough secondary action to keep things moving along at a brisk , amusing pace . 
SUBJECTIVE:in a summer overrun with movies dominated by cgi aliens and super heroes , it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway . 
SUBJECTIVE:evans is such a capable storyteller that you find yourself liking him even though he's not exactly likeable . 
SUBJECTIVE:for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together . 
SUBJECTIVE:fred schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . with a cast of a-list brit actors , it is worth searching out . 
SUBJECTIVE:the acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production's austere locales . 
SUBJECTIVE:undercover brother doesn't go far enough . it's just a silly black genre spoof . 
SUBJECTIVE:i have to admit i walked out of runteldat . i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes . 
SUBJECTIVE:disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies…or any other john woo flick for that matter . 
SUBJECTIVE:ranks with such films as in the bedroom , ordinary people , and terms of endearment in the sensitivity with which it observes the effect a child's death on the remaining members of the family . 
SUBJECTIVE:time out plays out slowly , but vincent's disconnectedness creates odd suspense and black humor . 
SUBJECTIVE:i'm not sure all about lily chou-chou made sense in my head , but it made sense in my heart . 
SUBJECTIVE:needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey . 
SUBJECTIVE:a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 
SUBJECTIVE:in auteil's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work . 
SUBJECTIVE:stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros . -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green's half-hearted movie career . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's got the brawn , but not the brains . 
SUBJECTIVE:an entertaining and poignantly bittersweet take-down of a good man's midlife crisis . 
SUBJECTIVE:alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl . 
SUBJECTIVE:hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes . 
SUBJECTIVE:there is a fine psychological thriller about divided loyalties and ambiguous identities buried with all the rubble and the maimed bodies , and mr . han and ms . kim play their slightly absurd roles with brisk sincerity
SUBJECTIVE:you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .

SUBJECTIVE: . . . the movie just seemed to be trying too hard to be something different . . 
SUBJECTIVE:a kinetic drama that seems to wander aimlessly , beautifully until it crashes in an odd anti-climax befitting reality itself .

SUBJECTIVE:the solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's a vastness implied in metropolis that is just breathtaking . 
SUBJECTIVE:williams has now proven that he can play creepy with the best of them . 
SUBJECTIVE:a " home alone " film that is staged like " rosemary's baby , " but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 
SUBJECTIVE:even if you don't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it . 
SUBJECTIVE:son of the bride manages to be affectionate without drawing too deeply from a well of sugar and schmaltz . 
SUBJECTIVE:the graphic carnage and re-creation of war-torn croatia is uncomfortably timely , relevant , and sickeningly real . 
SUBJECTIVE:proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
SUBJECTIVE:well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons . 
SUBJECTIVE:suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal .

SUBJECTIVE:ao sair do cinema , eu estava feliz e com saudades de um tempo em que , para mim , a existência de papai noel era um fato inquestionável . 
SUBJECTIVE:the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal . 
SUBJECTIVE:a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half . 
SUBJECTIVE:talk to her manages to be female-centric even as it explores the lives of men . 
SUBJECTIVE:if the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that's because panic room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in…and making you sweat . 
SUBJECTIVE:lovingly photographed in the manner of a golden book sprung to life , stuart little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness . 
SUBJECTIVE: " the ring " is pretty much an english-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws . 
SUBJECTIVE:an old-fashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale of the kind they rarely make anymore . 
SUBJECTIVE:mark pellington's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth . 
SUBJECTIVE:looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor . 
SUBJECTIVE:mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor . 
SUBJECTIVE:while the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo . . . broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity . 
SUBJECTIVE:just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time . 
SUBJECTIVE:what emerges is not only a portrait of some of the more colorful denizens of mayport , florida , but also a moving examination of the power of art to transform lives . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . 
SUBJECTIVE:one of the film's strongest achievements is the way it manages to get so much mileage out of such a simple concept as spirals . 
SUBJECTIVE:in a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the discovery channel . but in imax 3-d , the clichés disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography . 
SUBJECTIVE:broomfield seems to uncover a massive scoop here , revealing the multitude of people involved and the possible motivations behind the killings of his titular subjects . 
SUBJECTIVE:one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters . 
SUBJECTIVE:it gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect , and is engrossing and moving in its own right . 
SUBJECTIVE:the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 
SUBJECTIVE:the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
SUBJECTIVE:cletis is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer . 
SUBJECTIVE:we're not talking a disney treasure here , but if treasure planet falls short of gem status , it should provide youngsters with a reasonable amount of diversion . 
SUBJECTIVE:i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . 
SUBJECTIVE:it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media . . . to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
SUBJECTIVE:[toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material . 
SUBJECTIVE:reign of fire may well be the most grim dragon movie ever made -- and it's all the more effective for the filmmakers' decision to play it straight .

SUBJECTIVE:like a tarantino movie with heart , alias betty is richly detailed , deftly executed and utterly absorbing . 
SUBJECTIVE:not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit , but for the rest of us -- especially san francisco lovers -- it's a spirited film and a must-see . 
SUBJECTIVE:occasionally funny , always very colorful and enjoyably overblown in the traditional almodóvar style . 
SUBJECTIVE:oscar wilde's masterpiece , the importance of being earnest , may be the best play of the 19th century . it's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even oliver parker's movie adaptation .

SUBJECTIVE:woody allen's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz . 
SUBJECTIVE:the far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past .

SUBJECTIVE:credit director ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is rich with colorful characters and enlivened by its strong , convincing picture of rural trinidad . 
SUBJECTIVE:both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter . 
SUBJECTIVE:true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull . 
SUBJECTIVE:i'm not a fan of the phrase 'life affirming' because it usually means 'schmaltzy , ' but real women have curves truly is life affirming .

SUBJECTIVE:leading a double life in an american film only comes to no good , but not here . matters play out realistically if not always fairly . 
SUBJECTIVE:colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical . . . the rare sequel that's better than its predecessor . 
SUBJECTIVE:though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .

SUBJECTIVE:a haunting , rich film . . . [fraser] and caine blend beautifully with their sweet-and-sour mix of acting .

SUBJECTIVE:e . t . works because its flabbergasting principals , 14-year-old robert macnaughton , 6-year-old drew barrymore and 10-year-old henry thomas , convince us of the existence of the wise , wizened visitor from a faraway planet . 
SUBJECTIVE:a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride .

SUBJECTIVE:opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled " glory : a soldier's story . " 
SUBJECTIVE:as the national media become more sedate and incurious , this country desperately needs a gadfly like moore . indeed , we need more like him . 
SUBJECTIVE:the hot topics of the plot are relegated to the background -- a welcome step forward from the sally jesse raphael atmosphere of films like philadelphia and american beauty .

SUBJECTIVE:scores by marshaling facts that speak for themselves . and they don't speak kindly . 
SUBJECTIVE:twohy is not only skilled at building and maintaining suspense , he's also aware that a cast chock full of experienced character actors is the right fit for a haunted sub flick .

SUBJECTIVE:as charming , humorous and heimisch as its nomadic subjects . 
SUBJECTIVE:something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is so de palma . if you love him , you'll like it . if you don't . . . well , skip to another review . 
SUBJECTIVE:windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live . 
SUBJECTIVE:it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation . 
SUBJECTIVE:davis has filled out his cast with appealing fresh faces . 
SUBJECTIVE:the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox . 
SUBJECTIVE:para analizar esta película , es preciso separar dos criterios , el religioso y el cinematográfico
SUBJECTIVE:viewers of " the ring " are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes . 
SUBJECTIVE:frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music . 
SUBJECTIVE:boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a more believable scenario for infidelity than most such movies , and aniston gives her all to the role . 
SUBJECTIVE:you can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer . thumbs down . 
SUBJECTIVE:reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining . 
SUBJECTIVE:the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 
SUBJECTIVE:its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy . 
SUBJECTIVE:toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well ; everything is delivered with such conviction that it's hard not to be carried away . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie is a meditation on the love and envy that russia has always felt toward europe , and i won't pretend i got more than 30 percent of what was going on . 
SUBJECTIVE:time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable . 
SUBJECTIVE:suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum . punish the vehicle to adore the star . 
SUBJECTIVE:poor ben bratt couldn't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . 
SUBJECTIVE:all the performances are top notch and , once you get through the accents , all or nothing becomes an emotional , though still positive , wrench of a sit . 
SUBJECTIVE:what is unique about his secret life is that an assumption of intelligence , tolerance , and acceptance is already made , and thus the movie can focus on telling a compelling story . 
SUBJECTIVE:it is compelling to be exposed to a film as bluntly honest and yet as paradoxically ordinary as last orders . 
SUBJECTIVE:director roger michell does so many of the little things right that it's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff . 
SUBJECTIVE:fans of the modern day hong kong action film finally have the worthy successor to a better tomorrow and the killer which they have been patiently waiting for . 
SUBJECTIVE:in this age of soulless , fx-driven action franchises raimi anachronistically emphasizes character development . 
SUBJECTIVE:if there was a flu shot for the blues , it might come in the form of this embraceable ode to loneliness and love regained . 
SUBJECTIVE:no , it's not as single-minded as john carpenter's original , but it's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . 
SUBJECTIVE:the experience of watching blobby old-school cgi animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting . 
SUBJECTIVE:the misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten . 
SUBJECTIVE:what bloody sunday lacks in clarity , it makes up for with a great , fiery passion . 
SUBJECTIVE:aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music . 
SUBJECTIVE:you've seen it before : the ex-con who stumbles while striving to assimilate back into society . but writer-director joe maggio and his able cast makes you care about this man's sorry journey in virgil bliss . 
SUBJECTIVE:apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 
SUBJECTIVE:no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars . 
SUBJECTIVE:marlon brando has the godfather , laurence olivier has hamlet , and now tim allen has . . . santa claus . 
SUBJECTIVE:red dragon makes one appreciate silence of the lambs . 
SUBJECTIVE:' . . . a great , participatory spectator sport . '
SUBJECTIVE:the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
SUBJECTIVE:so fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated . not to mention absolutely refreshed . 
SUBJECTIVE:the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession . 
SUBJECTIVE:goyer's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast . 
SUBJECTIVE:with exquisite craftsmanship . . . olivier assayas has fashioned an absorbing look at provincial bourgeois french society . 
SUBJECTIVE:we've seen it all before in one form or another , but director hoffman , with great help from kevin kline , makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world's greatest teacher . 
SUBJECTIVE:what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting . 
SUBJECTIVE:one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature . 
SUBJECTIVE:star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before . wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty . 
SUBJECTIVE:insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion . but the performances of pacino , williams , and swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through . 
SUBJECTIVE:flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . 
SUBJECTIVE:birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters . 
SUBJECTIVE:destined to make allen's fans around the world giggle , guffaw and shiver with delight . 
SUBJECTIVE:follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
SUBJECTIVE:the pianist [is] a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life . here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music . 
SUBJECTIVE:sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy . . . attal looks so much like a young robert deniro that it seems the film should instead be called 'my husband is travis bickle' . 
SUBJECTIVE:its aims are modest -- to make kids laugh as cuba gooding falls down a lot and to show how thrilling sled dogs are -- and it achieves them . 
SUBJECTIVE:sayles has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group . 
SUBJECTIVE:a boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- well , i'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop . 
SUBJECTIVE:the lady and the duke is eric rohmer's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama
SUBJECTIVE:the performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times . 
SUBJECTIVE:you'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot . you'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus . 
SUBJECTIVE:a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . 
SUBJECTIVE:brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women's depression . 
SUBJECTIVE:this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work . 
SUBJECTIVE:as the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , [franco] has all of dean's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare's macbeth doesn't sustain a high enough level of invention . 
SUBJECTIVE:boasting the best sword-fighting sequences to hit the screen in many years , it is so enjoyably old-fashioned it even looks as if it were made in the '70s . 
SUBJECTIVE:sorvino is delightful in the central role . she nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit . 
SUBJECTIVE:tadpole may be small , but it's something special -- a cheeky comedy knockout . 
SUBJECTIVE:more sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are . . . an amusing little catch . 
SUBJECTIVE:the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be . 
SUBJECTIVE:has enough wit , energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they're not interested . 
SUBJECTIVE:almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited . and in a sense , that's a liability . 
SUBJECTIVE:the you-are-there style ultimately enhances abc africa's ability to get inside the soul of uganda , and of the viewer . 
SUBJECTIVE:as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious . 
SUBJECTIVE:a riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey into an urban hades . 
SUBJECTIVE:exactly what you'd expect from a guy named kaos . 
SUBJECTIVE:told just proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings . 
SUBJECTIVE:nicks , seemingly uncertain what's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . 
SUBJECTIVE:ice age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ? 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure . 
SUBJECTIVE:filled with alexandre desplat's haunting and sublime music , the movie completely transfixes the audience . 
SUBJECTIVE:constantly touching , surprisingly funny , semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act . 
SUBJECTIVE:the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch . 
SUBJECTIVE:the surprising skill and compassion that group's makers exhibit turns what could have been an uninvolving actor's exercise into a compelling and complicated emotional stew . 
SUBJECTIVE:a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . 
SUBJECTIVE:[janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
SUBJECTIVE:isn't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues , 'blade ii' just doesn't cut it . 
SUBJECTIVE:while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences . 
SUBJECTIVE:a self-narrated , blatantly lop-sided , cocky , nonchalant , fascinating and juicily entertaining documentary . 
SUBJECTIVE:where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 
SUBJECTIVE:chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe . 
SUBJECTIVE:reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film . 
SUBJECTIVE:bittersweet comedy/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable italian guys . 
SUBJECTIVE:there is a refreshing absence of cynicism in stuart little 2--quite a rarity , even in the family film market . eventually , it wins you over . 
SUBJECTIVE:often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed . 
SUBJECTIVE:there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
SUBJECTIVE: " die another day " is a worthy entry in the pantheon of james bond movies . 
SUBJECTIVE:its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more . 
SUBJECTIVE:like mike is a harmlessly naïve slice of b-ball fantasy , fit for filling in during the real nba's off-season . 
SUBJECTIVE:a gorgeously strange movie , heaven is deeply concerned with morality , but it refuses to spell things out for viewers . 
SUBJECTIVE:sweet gentle jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ? 
SUBJECTIVE:outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's filthy . it's sexist . and it's hilarious for adult audiences who appreciate lawrence's raunchy approach and perfect timing . 
SUBJECTIVE:the best of the pierce brosnan james bond films to date . 
SUBJECTIVE:as a singular character study , it's perfect . it's also the year's sweetest movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:while general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music , they'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds . 
SUBJECTIVE:miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , expertly plucking tension from quiet . 
SUBJECTIVE:femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
SUBJECTIVE:mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's enough here to keep the sequel rocking , providing you can leave the adult in you at the door . 
SUBJECTIVE:it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest -– audience sadism -- is evaded completely . 
SUBJECTIVE:[denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product . 
SUBJECTIVE: ( wendigo is ) why we go to the cinema : to be fed through the eye , the heart , the mind . 
SUBJECTIVE:a film at once depressing and uplifting--depressing in terms of the sad , often horrifying subjects of nachtwey's photographs but uplifting in terms of his commitment and integrity . 
SUBJECTIVE:possesses something rare : a degree of genuine reverence in its depiction of surfing as a sport and a subculture . 
SUBJECTIVE:what saves it . . . and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice . 
SUBJECTIVE:the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's up to [watts] to lend credibility to this strange scenario , and her presence succeeds in making us believe . 
SUBJECTIVE:if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . 
SUBJECTIVE:the urban landscapes are detailed down to the signs on the kiosks , and the color palette , with lots of somber blues and pinks , is dreamy and evocative . 
SUBJECTIVE: " austin powers in goldmember " has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end . 
SUBJECTIVE:beautifully crafted and brutally honest , promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the middle east struggle and into the humanity of its people . 
SUBJECTIVE:while broomfield's film doesn't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture , it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system . 
SUBJECTIVE:about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces . . . positively dreadful . 
SUBJECTIVE:this movie is more fun than many of those tall tales that hollywood calls feature films . 
SUBJECTIVE:if it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life's urgent questions . 
SUBJECTIVE:though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium . 
SUBJECTIVE:just like his characters , writer-director alfonso cuar&oacute ; n . . . takes the road less traveled . 
SUBJECTIVE:as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character . 
SUBJECTIVE:ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
SUBJECTIVE:bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
SUBJECTIVE:may lack the pungent bite of its title , but it's an enjoyable trifle nonetheless . 
SUBJECTIVE:r xmas offers a poetic and profane ambiguity that's vintage ferrara . 
SUBJECTIVE:a thoughtful look at a painful incident that made headlines in 1995 . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer's most pleasurable movies . 
SUBJECTIVE:weiss and speck capture the rich , turbulent tapestry of the manns' lives . 
SUBJECTIVE:a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional . 
SUBJECTIVE:a low-key labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . delivers few moments of inspiration amid the bland animation and simplistic story . 
SUBJECTIVE:no such thing may be far from perfect , but those small , odd hartley touches help you warm to it . 
SUBJECTIVE:kiarostami profoundly displays uganda's life and culture through his touristy pictures , as deceptively simple as the alphabet
SUBJECTIVE:the farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one . 
SUBJECTIVE:horns and halos benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese . 
SUBJECTIVE:the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . a rousing fantasy of bloodless revolution against capricious colonial rulers . 
SUBJECTIVE:this story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess . 
SUBJECTIVE:the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable . 
SUBJECTIVE:a quirky noir film crammed full of wonderful characters made memorable by excellent acting . 
SUBJECTIVE:outside of burger's desire to make some kind of film , it's really unclear why this project was undertaken
SUBJECTIVE:the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are . 
SUBJECTIVE:the fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react . 
SUBJECTIVE:a pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between xxx and vertical limit . 
SUBJECTIVE:goes some way towards explaining how the tragedy occurred and its enduring legacy today . 
SUBJECTIVE:the best thing i can say about this film is that i can't wait to see what the director does next . 
SUBJECTIVE:one can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman's brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
SUBJECTIVE:a budget affair that exposes the generally sad existence of the bedouins while providing a precious twinkle of insight into their lives . 
SUBJECTIVE:watching haneke's film is , aptly enough , a challenge and a punishment . but watching huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting . 
SUBJECTIVE:will give many ministers and bible-study groups hours of material to discuss . but mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted . 
SUBJECTIVE:greg kinnear gives a mesmerizing performance as a full-fledged sex addict who is in complete denial about his obsessive behavior . 
SUBJECTIVE:you feel like you're the one moving at 80 mph , not the street lugers . 
SUBJECTIVE:though the controversial korean filmmaker's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding . 
SUBJECTIVE:a graceful , contemplative film that gradually and artfully draws us into a world where the personal and the political get fatally intertwined . 
SUBJECTIVE:the inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power , as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time . 
SUBJECTIVE:marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie . 
SUBJECTIVE: " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes . 
SUBJECTIVE:a decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies . 
SUBJECTIVE:rhames is a tightly harnessed bundle of fury , snipes a restrained champion who seems to have made inner peace with the crime of passion that sent him away for life , and falk a riveting delight . 
SUBJECTIVE:perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
SUBJECTIVE:merchant hasn't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage . 
SUBJECTIVE:this may be dover kosashvili's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic . 
SUBJECTIVE:this comic gem is as delightful as it is derivative . 
SUBJECTIVE:the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays . 
SUBJECTIVE:for all the realpolitik underpinnings , this is less john le carre than a tech noir " die hard " in downtown seoul . 
SUBJECTIVE:an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years . 
SUBJECTIVE:for anyone who cares about the future of america , it's required viewing . 
SUBJECTIVE:undisputed is undeniable fun , thanks to its rugged rock pile of attitude , bravado and fisticuffs . 
SUBJECTIVE:how good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not . 
SUBJECTIVE:a lyrical if sluggish excursion set in war-torn iranian kurdistan . 
SUBJECTIVE:the weakest of the four harry potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins . 
SUBJECTIVE:all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject . 
SUBJECTIVE:it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that's more or less how it plays out . 
SUBJECTIVE:fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
SUBJECTIVE:diane lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in unfaithful . 
SUBJECTIVE:mike leigh mainstay timothy spall deftly shades in the designated goner , fellow still crazy alum bill nighy is sweetly wispy as the capable fop , and anger-management counselor olivia williams trembles pleasantly as usual . 
SUBJECTIVE:davis' candid , archly funny and deeply authentic take on intimate relationships comes to fruition in her sophomore effort . 
SUBJECTIVE:the story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me . 
SUBJECTIVE:birot's directorial debut ( she co-wrote the script with christophe honoré ) isn't so much bad as it is bland . 
SUBJECTIVE:makes the sweet case that sincerity strikes the biggest romantic sparks . 
SUBJECTIVE:[gosling's] combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex , unpredictable character . 
SUBJECTIVE:a movie that's just plain awful but still manages to entertain on a guilty-pleasure , so-bad-it's-funny level . 
SUBJECTIVE:well , jason's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , don't shoot the messenger ) . 
SUBJECTIVE:director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama . 
SUBJECTIVE:writer-director debrauwer does manage to wrap things up in an * * * -pleasing 78 minutes . it's isn't much , but it's a lot more than callous callie khouri did with that " ya-ya " mess . also , there are no irritating hats . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
SUBJECTIVE:the way home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and . . . often misconstrued as weakness . 
SUBJECTIVE:bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad . 
SUBJECTIVE:a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence . 
SUBJECTIVE:if we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get . 
SUBJECTIVE:the jokes sometimes fall flat , but the weirdness and darkening of tone make for quirky fun . 
SUBJECTIVE:the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment . 
SUBJECTIVE:watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff . 
SUBJECTIVE:full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the linux cause . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring . 
SUBJECTIVE:[a]n utterly charming and hilarious film that reminded me of the best of the disney comedies from the 60s . 
SUBJECTIVE:as broad and cartoonish as the screenplay is , there is an accuracy of observation in the work of the director , frank novak , that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of sarah and harrison . 
SUBJECTIVE:what blood work lacks in speed and surprise it almost makes up for in doughty professionalism . 
SUBJECTIVE:kitchen scenes playing as obvious and light-hearted metaphors for states of mind and relationships , mostly martha leaves a few elements hanging that it probably should have tidied . 
SUBJECTIVE:if signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere . 
SUBJECTIVE:so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 
SUBJECTIVE:coppola's directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that , despite a fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development , still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema . 
SUBJECTIVE:it winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say . 
SUBJECTIVE:hawn and sarandon hit the ground running , and are so funny and goofy that they distract and delight us . 
SUBJECTIVE:recoing's fantastic performance doesn't exactly reveal what makes vincent tick , but perhaps any definitive explanation for it would have felt like a cheat . 
SUBJECTIVE:message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is pure , exciting moviemaking . you won't exactly know what's happening but you'll be blissfully exhausted . 
SUBJECTIVE:there is a genius to ( this ) experimental and utterly surreal historical epic that has nothing to do with the fact that it was shot in one uninterrupted , mind-boggling take . . . 
SUBJECTIVE:a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
SUBJECTIVE:high drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky . 
SUBJECTIVE: " nicholas nickleby " is a perfect family film to take everyone to since there's no new " a christmas carol " out in the theaters this year . charlie hunnam has the twinkling eyes , repressed smile and determined face needed to carry out a dickensian hero . 
SUBJECTIVE:the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard . 
SUBJECTIVE:a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python's meaning of life . 
SUBJECTIVE:has its moments -- and almost as many subplots . 
SUBJECTIVE:little incidents pile up , and eventually what was strange becomes terrifying . 
SUBJECTIVE:ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout — and meat loaf explodes . 
SUBJECTIVE:the chateau . . . is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters . 
SUBJECTIVE:egoyan boldly inspires viewers to deal with issues of cultural memory and responsibility , especially in moments of confusion when family issues intersect with monumental historical facts . 
SUBJECTIVE:harrison's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's an energy to y tu mamá también . much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors . 
SUBJECTIVE:with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike . 
SUBJECTIVE:[fiji diver rusi vulakoro and the married couple howard and michelle hall] show us the world they love and make us love it , too . 
SUBJECTIVE:this film is full of rabbits . brimful . but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance . 
SUBJECTIVE:[breheny's] lensing of the new zealand and cook island locations captures both the beauty of the land and the people . 
SUBJECTIVE:the first shocking thing about sorority boys is that it's actually watchable . even more baffling is that it's funny . 
SUBJECTIVE:though a capable thriller , somewhere along the way k-19 jettisoned some crucial drama .

SUBJECTIVE:the film proves unrelentingly grim -- and equally engrossing . 
SUBJECTIVE:the heart of the film is the drop dead sexy drea de matteo who , as the mother and real head of the family , commands every scene .

SUBJECTIVE:a sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer . 
SUBJECTIVE:montias . . . pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters .

SUBJECTIVE:here , adrian lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get . 
SUBJECTIVE:lan yu is at times too restrained , yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most american love stories look downright unfree .

SUBJECTIVE:purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .

SUBJECTIVE:the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging . 
SUBJECTIVE:a winning crowd-pleaser with more than enough juice to crossover with fans of all stripes , regardless of whether they even know anything about soccer or not . 
SUBJECTIVE:it has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out . 
SUBJECTIVE:smith profiles five extraordinary american homes , and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame , it's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities . 
SUBJECTIVE:you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . 
SUBJECTIVE:the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo .

SUBJECTIVE:both flawed and delayed , martin scorcese's gangs of new york still emerges as his most vital work since goodfellas .

SUBJECTIVE:the first hour alone is worth the admission price . 
SUBJECTIVE:not one moment in the enterprise didn't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow . 
SUBJECTIVE:because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you're far better served by the source material . 
SUBJECTIVE:no better or worse than 'truth or consequences , n . m . ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater . 
SUBJECTIVE:the end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump . 
SUBJECTIVE:the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 
SUBJECTIVE:the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone . 
SUBJECTIVE:benigni's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow . 
SUBJECTIVE:grief is awkward and funny and strange sometimes . so is moonlight mile . 
SUBJECTIVE:its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy . 
SUBJECTIVE:a carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling--but unquestionably alive . 
SUBJECTIVE:can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies . . . except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .

SUBJECTIVE:those who savor well-drawn characters and exotic locales will find the touch of the mystic masseur to be most pleasurable indeed . 
SUBJECTIVE:a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . 
SUBJECTIVE:not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . 
SUBJECTIVE:an entertaining mix of period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans .

SUBJECTIVE:kudos to director doug liman for injecting textbook spy fare with slick intelligence and a truckload of tension . 
SUBJECTIVE:taken seriously , it's not much to think about , but taken as a dirtier version of other girlie films . . . it's at least entertaining and sexy fun . 
SUBJECTIVE:though lan yu lacks a sense of dramatic urgency , the film makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude . 
SUBJECTIVE:the only entertainment you'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles – several of them . 
SUBJECTIVE:the grey zone gives voice to a story that needs to be heard in the sea of holocaust movies . . . but the film suffers from its own difficulties . 
SUBJECTIVE:all the movie's narrative gymnastics can't disguise the fact that it's inauthentic at its core and that its story just isn't worth telling . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's thoroughly entertaining and nonpatronizing , and occasionally even insightful . 
SUBJECTIVE:never quite transcends jokester status . . . and the punchline doesn't live up to barry's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . skirts the edges of snide condescension only to then abruptly catch the viewer off-guard with lightning strikes of genuine emotion .

SUBJECTIVE:a hypnotic portrait of this sad , compulsive life . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a pleasurable revelation to see foster feel out a role , both emotively and physically , with the well-marshaled gusto that she does here . 
SUBJECTIVE:both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time . 
SUBJECTIVE:works better in the conception than it does in the execution . . . winds up seeming just a little too clever . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show . . . represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it . 
SUBJECTIVE:pratfalls aside , barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor . 
SUBJECTIVE:once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . with " the bourne identity " we return to the more traditional action genre . 
SUBJECTIVE:an uncomfortable movie , suffocating and sometimes almost senseless , the grey zone does have a center , though a morbid one . 
SUBJECTIVE:been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
SUBJECTIVE:it follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every schwarzenegger film : someone crosses arnie . arnie blows things up . 
SUBJECTIVE:a little judicious editing would have helped a lot , but the talented cast matches the film's ambitions and compensates for its modest budget . 
SUBJECTIVE:in all , this is a watchable movie that's not quite the memorable experience it might have been . 
SUBJECTIVE:theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
SUBJECTIVE:a great looking , trippy adventure . i can't wait for the next one . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it .

SUBJECTIVE:it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny . 
SUBJECTIVE:harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research . 
SUBJECTIVE:a funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a british cast to rival gosford park's . 
SUBJECTIVE:this big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you're looking for a smart , nuanced look at de sade and what might have happened at picpus , sade is your film . 
SUBJECTIVE:blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in kieran culkin a pitch-perfect holden .

SUBJECTIVE:a witty coming-of-middle-age comedy with hilarious performances by first-time director tony shalhoub and wife brooke adams . 
SUBJECTIVE:its valuable message makes it a must-see for children and teenagers , and even more so for those callous adults who have become casually corrupt in their efforts to simply get through life . 
SUBJECTIVE:the embodiment of the very message it so modestly conveys -- it's the accomplished little guy we fervently root for . 
SUBJECTIVE:derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
SUBJECTIVE:american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an indian-american would recognize . and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new .

SUBJECTIVE:allen's underestimated charm delivers more goodies than lumps of coal . 
SUBJECTIVE:soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .

SUBJECTIVE:it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) .

SUBJECTIVE:the adventure doesn't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 . 
SUBJECTIVE:in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context . 
SUBJECTIVE:a guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it . 
SUBJECTIVE:a sad , superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite a quieter middle section , involving aragorn's dreams of arwen , this is even better than the fellowship . there are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away . 
SUBJECTIVE:pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs . 
SUBJECTIVE:a rollicking ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending . 
SUBJECTIVE:steven soderbergh's digital video experiment is a clever and cutting , quick and dirty look at modern living and movie life . 
SUBJECTIVE:no wonder they're talking about " talk to her . " it's astonishing .

SUBJECTIVE:there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 .

SUBJECTIVE:the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
SUBJECTIVE:improves when it takes a more serious tone and zaza and judith develop into deeper characterizations . 
SUBJECTIVE:a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense . 
SUBJECTIVE:captivates and shows how a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary . . . 
SUBJECTIVE:murderous maids pulls no punches in its depiction of the lives of the papin sister and the events that led to their notorious rise to infamy . . .

SUBJECTIVE:the performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles . 
SUBJECTIVE:feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
SUBJECTIVE:the script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors . 
SUBJECTIVE:a genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives . 
SUBJECTIVE:the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no . 1 , but falls apart long before the end .

SUBJECTIVE:a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction . 
SUBJECTIVE:canada's arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the inuit people . 
SUBJECTIVE:although shot with little style , skins is heartfelt and achingly real . 
SUBJECTIVE:every once in a while , a movie will come along that turns me into that annoying specimen of humanity that i usually dread encountering the most - the fanboy
SUBJECTIVE:a densely constructed , highly referential film , and an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among jean-luc godard's finest work . 
SUBJECTIVE:berling and béart . . . continue to impress , and isabelle huppert . . . again shows uncanny skill in getting under the skin of her characters . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 
SUBJECTIVE:a resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution . 
SUBJECTIVE:visually fascinating . . . an often intense character study about fathers and sons , loyalty and duty . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie , despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places , is wry and engrossing . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and i think that's what i liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's the most nimble epic you're likely to see . 
SUBJECTIVE:the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide . 
SUBJECTIVE:it may not be the most immediate or attention-grabbing work , but there's certainly something satisfying in its thoughtfulness . 
SUBJECTIVE:those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking . 
SUBJECTIVE:its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there's no time to think about them anyway . 
SUBJECTIVE:in visual fertility treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage . 
SUBJECTIVE:the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito's early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .

SUBJECTIVE:too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through . 
SUBJECTIVE:what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess . 
SUBJECTIVE:the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff . 
SUBJECTIVE:this crafty little mystery/thriller deserves a wider audience -- if for no other reason than its attention to period detail , its subtlety and its emphasis on mood . 
SUBJECTIVE:in the end , egoyan's enormous talent and mychael danna's intense score keep ararat interesting and emotional . 
SUBJECTIVE:neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price . 
SUBJECTIVE:where as many films of this nature linger on the hard , the ugly , the blood , or just the stylistic ; empire focuses on the thinking , the love , and even the light-heartedness , as well as the violence .

SUBJECTIVE:solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts .

SUBJECTIVE:bow's best moments are when he's getting busy on the basketball court because that's when he really scores . 
SUBJECTIVE:the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition . 
SUBJECTIVE:'blue crush' swims away with the sleeper movie of the summer award . 
SUBJECTIVE:unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
SUBJECTIVE:'butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach . 
SUBJECTIVE:a heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers' hearts . 
SUBJECTIVE:trapped won't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness . 
SUBJECTIVE:[screenwriter] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation . 
SUBJECTIVE:critics need a good laugh , too , and this too-extreme-for-tv rendition of the notorious mtv show delivers the outrageous , sickening , sidesplitting goods in steaming , visceral heaps . 
SUBJECTIVE:parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic . but mostly it's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived . 
SUBJECTIVE:maybe the title should have been confusions of a dangerous mind , though the confusion , in this case , can be pretty sublime . 
SUBJECTIVE:the campy results make mel brooks' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated .

SUBJECTIVE:slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by . 
SUBJECTIVE:the ring is worth a look , if you don't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your halloween entertainment . 
SUBJECTIVE:much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there isn't much there here . 
SUBJECTIVE:a real audience-pleaser that will strike a chord with anyone who's ever waited in a doctor's office , emergency room , hospital bed or insurance company office . 
SUBJECTIVE:it is the sheer , selfish , wound-licking , bar-scrapping doggedness of leon's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion , despite its patchy construction . 
SUBJECTIVE:a beguiling splash of pastel colors and prankish comedy from disney . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses . 
SUBJECTIVE:a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . 
SUBJECTIVE:hardly an objective documentary , but it's great cinematic polemic . . . love moore or loathe him , you've got to admire . . . the intensity with which he's willing to express his convictions . 
SUBJECTIVE:zhuangzhuang creates delicate balance of style , text , and subtext that's so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance , but against all odds , nothing does . 
SUBJECTIVE:the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
SUBJECTIVE:now i can see why people thought i was too hard on " the mothman prophecies " .

SUBJECTIVE:this isn't an original film , but it is an effective one . 
SUBJECTIVE:if borstal boy isn't especially realistic , it is an engaging nostalgia piece .

SUBJECTIVE:the footage of the rappers at play and the prison interview with suge knight are just two of the elements that will grab you . 
SUBJECTIVE:dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 
SUBJECTIVE:the charm of the first movie is still there , and the story feels like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids .

SUBJECTIVE:this bold and cathartic drama deserves to be experienced by those who cherish intimate dramas about individuals struggling against all odds to practice love , compassion , and forgiveness . 
SUBJECTIVE:harmon opts to show less and suggest more , and the script's gloomy downer of an ending is audacious . 
SUBJECTIVE:returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy . 
SUBJECTIVE:jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive .

SUBJECTIVE:john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:an utterly compelling 'who wrote it' in which the reputation of the most famous author who ever lived comes into question .

SUBJECTIVE:the documentary makes no waves and tries to be as upbeat as the musicians it tells about . 
SUBJECTIVE:an ironic speculation on democracy in a culture unaccustomed to it . 
SUBJECTIVE:a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie is well crafted , and well executed . if you're paying attention , the " big twists " are pretty easy to guess - but that doesn't make the movie any less entertaining . 
SUBJECTIVE:it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . i can't . 
SUBJECTIVE:a beguiling , slow-moving parable about the collision of past and present on a remote seacoast in iran . 
SUBJECTIVE:though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
SUBJECTIVE:you may be captivated , as i was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear .

SUBJECTIVE:alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors . 
SUBJECTIVE:the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .

SUBJECTIVE:i walked away from this new version of e . t . just as i hoped i would -- with moist eyes . 
SUBJECTIVE:though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia's true emotions . . . but at the very least , his secret life will leave you thinking .

SUBJECTIVE:an intelligent and sobering look at a person's self worth , and the measures he or she will take to restore it .

SUBJECTIVE:a fascinating , dark thriller that keeps you hooked on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality .

SUBJECTIVE:the writer-director bestows honor -- generously , apolitically -- not only on the dead and still living american veterans who fought in ia drang , but also on their families , on their vietnamese adversaries , and on the families of their adversaries too . 
SUBJECTIVE:perhaps the most remarkable aspect of murderous maids is how restrained and sensitive french director jean-pierre denis keeps his film . 
SUBJECTIVE:the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived-in glow . 
SUBJECTIVE:movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt . 
SUBJECTIVE:what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . 
SUBJECTIVE:evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking . 
SUBJECTIVE:the tonal shifts are jolting , and though wen's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive . 
SUBJECTIVE:the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years . 
SUBJECTIVE:it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
SUBJECTIVE:kapur's contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie that works against itself . 
SUBJECTIVE:a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you haven't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg's work . much of it is funny , but there are also some startling , surrealistic moments . . . 
SUBJECTIVE:beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
SUBJECTIVE:poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures . 
SUBJECTIVE:often messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments , it's very much like life itself . 
SUBJECTIVE:a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending . 
SUBJECTIVE:a captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait , romantic comedy and beat-the-clock thriller . 
SUBJECTIVE:like any good romance , son of the bride , proves it's never too late to learn . 
SUBJECTIVE:for those of an indulgent , slightly sunbaked and summery mind , sex and lucia may well prove diverting enough .

SUBJECTIVE:expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery . 
SUBJECTIVE:a suspense thriller with a brain and a heart . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience . 
SUBJECTIVE:one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking . 
SUBJECTIVE:the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed . 
SUBJECTIVE:epic battles , spectacular effects and multiple story lines make the two towers a most excellent middle chapter in the lord of the rings film trilogy . 
SUBJECTIVE:rarely do films come along that are as intelligent , exuberant , and moving as monsoon wedding . 
SUBJECTIVE:the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament . 
SUBJECTIVE:a sweet-natured reconsideration of one of san francisco's most vital , if least widely recognized , creative fountainheads . 
SUBJECTIVE:based on a devilishly witty script by heather mcgowan and niels mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters
SUBJECTIVE:every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible . that , in itself , is extraordinary . 
SUBJECTIVE:it looks closely , insightfully at fragile , complex relationships . 
SUBJECTIVE:abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 
SUBJECTIVE:even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
SUBJECTIVE:de oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by michel piccoli . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of joan's madness . 
SUBJECTIVE:occasionally funny and consistently odd , and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for zhao . 
SUBJECTIVE:in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
SUBJECTIVE:the actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way . 
SUBJECTIVE:some people march to the beat of a different drum , and if you ever wondered what kind of houses those people live in , this documentary takes a look at 5 alternative housing options . 
SUBJECTIVE:together , miller , kuras and the actresses make personal velocity into an intricate , intimate and intelligent journey . 
SUBJECTIVE:will you go ape over this movie ? well , it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises , but it's definitely worth taking a look . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career , if they want one . 
SUBJECTIVE:look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music . 
SUBJECTIVE:piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
SUBJECTIVE:if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame . 
SUBJECTIVE:even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
SUBJECTIVE:a living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange . the fact that it isn't very good is almost beside the point . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness . 
SUBJECTIVE:noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama . 
SUBJECTIVE:it ain't art , by a long shot , but unlike last year's lame musketeer , this dumas adaptation entertains . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . 
SUBJECTIVE:i'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i don't see the point . it's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed . 
SUBJECTIVE:the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud . 
SUBJECTIVE:not just unlikable . disturbing . disgusting . without any redeeming value whatsoever . 
SUBJECTIVE:a wonderful , low-key coming-of-age saga with none of that after-school special hysteria . 
SUBJECTIVE:sunshine state is a fine example of a carefully written film . but you shouldn't be too aware that a movie is well-written . 
SUBJECTIVE:offers a quieter version of the midlife-crisis roller coaster . 
SUBJECTIVE:good for a few unintentional laughs , " extreme ops " was obviously made for the " xxx " crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction . 
SUBJECTIVE:the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission . 
SUBJECTIVE:overall very good for what it's trying to do . 
SUBJECTIVE:mazel tov to a film about a family's joyous life acting on the yiddish stage . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is christmas future for a lot of baby boomers . 
SUBJECTIVE:koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own . 
SUBJECTIVE:an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood . 
SUBJECTIVE:if routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $8 and get ready for the big shear . this is one baaaaaaaaad movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic . 
SUBJECTIVE:an exciting debut from promising , and fairly disturbed , young director/screenwriter dylan kidd . 
SUBJECTIVE:this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against . 
SUBJECTIVE:the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes , then you'll enjoy the hot chick . 
SUBJECTIVE:as commander-in-chief of this film , bigelow demonstrates a breadth of vision and an attention to detail that propels her into the upper echelons of the directing world . 
SUBJECTIVE:thanks to scott's charismatic roger and eisenberg's sweet nephew , roger dodger is one of the most compelling variations on in the company of men . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds . 
SUBJECTIVE:if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate .

SUBJECTIVE:it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish . 
SUBJECTIVE:an earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool . 
SUBJECTIVE:the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:an empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance . 
SUBJECTIVE:wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives ! 
SUBJECTIVE:what makes blade 2 marginally better than blade , especially if you thought the first was a hollow spectacle ? it has a plot .

SUBJECTIVE:behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise ! 
SUBJECTIVE:a triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light .

SUBJECTIVE:at its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers . 
SUBJECTIVE:that haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace . 
SUBJECTIVE:like lisa gossels' children of chabannes ( 2000 ) , which tells another little-known story about french villagers who saved 400 jewish children , shanghai ghetto is a celebration of humanity . 
SUBJECTIVE:the funk brothers seem to have hardly missed a beat . 
SUBJECTIVE:grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length
SUBJECTIVE:what lee does so marvelously compelling is present brown as a catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america . . . sketchy but nevertheless gripping portrait of jim brown , a celebrated wonder in the spotlight
SUBJECTIVE:the country bears wastes an exceptionally good idea . but the movie that doesn't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
SUBJECTIVE:as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan's gifts , which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project . 
SUBJECTIVE:the behind the scenes series is more interesting than the resulting movie , but it's still worth taking a look . 
SUBJECTIVE:woody allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody . but i had a lot of problems with this movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:all very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion . 
SUBJECTIVE:succeeds very well in its primary aim of making us gasp . 
SUBJECTIVE:director rob marshall went out gunning to make a great one . 
SUBJECTIVE:an unflinching , complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen on-screen . 
SUBJECTIVE:a vivid , spicy footnote to history , and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish . 
SUBJECTIVE:a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense . 
SUBJECTIVE:how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know . 
SUBJECTIVE:pan nalin's exposition is beautiful and mysterious , and the interviews that follow , with the practitioners of this ancient indian practice , are as subtle and as enigmatic . 
SUBJECTIVE:by turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious . 
SUBJECTIVE:is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ? 
SUBJECTIVE:gosling creates a staggeringly compelling character , a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory , self-hating , self-destructive ways . 
SUBJECTIVE:you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
SUBJECTIVE:for every inspired bit of absurdity , there's a lame piece of improvisational noodling . 
SUBJECTIVE:the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun . 
SUBJECTIVE:in its combination of religion , love story and exotic locales , " heaven " is a bit reminiscent of james michener's " hawaii , " although this is a somewhat simpler , more personal tale . 
SUBJECTIVE:[reynolds] takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch . 
SUBJECTIVE:strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild . 
SUBJECTIVE:at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot . 
SUBJECTIVE:exciting and direct , with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes . 
SUBJECTIVE:an excellent chance to learn more about one of rock and roll's most significant bands and the struggle for freedom in the communist world . 
SUBJECTIVE:nicholson's understated performance is wonderful . as warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he's neglected over the years . 
SUBJECTIVE:exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran bouquet and the chilling but quite human berling . 
SUBJECTIVE:if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch . 
SUBJECTIVE:the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
SUBJECTIVE:an operatic , sprawling picture that's entertainingly acted , magnificently shot and gripping enough to sustain most of its 170-minute length . 
SUBJECTIVE:the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 
SUBJECTIVE:essentially , this is abel fererra's it's a wonderful life . 
SUBJECTIVE:a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell . 
SUBJECTIVE:the heightened symmetry of this new/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie provides an intimate glimpse of how sensibilities as compatible as oil and water forced themselves to blend and create a successful work despite their aesthetic differences . 
SUBJECTIVE:why spend $9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ? 
SUBJECTIVE:a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you like blood , guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though . . . you will likely enjoy this monster . 
SUBJECTIVE: . . . has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they're ghosts imagining themselves as alive . it's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its " men in a sardine can " warped logic . 
SUBJECTIVE:fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it . 
SUBJECTIVE:director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the " miami vice " checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . 
SUBJECTIVE:a clichéd and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite the fact that this film wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be , it's still not a good movie
SUBJECTIVE:the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships . 
SUBJECTIVE:this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does . 
SUBJECTIVE:the aaa of action , xxx is a blast of adrenalin , rated eee for excitement . and vin diesel is the man . 
SUBJECTIVE:all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat . 
SUBJECTIVE:this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f . kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . but it's hardly a necessary enterprise . 
SUBJECTIVE:a hallmark film in an increasingly important film industry and worth the look . 
SUBJECTIVE:too artsy by half , heaven nonetheless casts a spell that doesn't break until you leave the theater . 
SUBJECTIVE:while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target . 
SUBJECTIVE:woo's fights have a distinct flair . his warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos . 
SUBJECTIVE:the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , 'hungry-man portions of bad' . 
SUBJECTIVE:a surprisingly good-natured throwback to the '80s heyday of the body-switching genre . 
SUBJECTIVE:acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes " never again " worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice
SUBJECTIVE:the movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design . 
SUBJECTIVE:on top of a foundering performance , [madonna's] denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 
SUBJECTIVE:martha is rich in contradictions , her tightly wound personality running counter to the sensual pleasure she offers others through her art . 
SUBJECTIVE:the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
SUBJECTIVE:elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 
SUBJECTIVE:a moving story of determination and the human spirit . 
SUBJECTIVE:a film that deserves to be seen regardless of the misgivings . 
SUBJECTIVE:takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker . 
SUBJECTIVE:even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 
SUBJECTIVE:a penetrating glimpse into the tissue-thin ego of the stand-up comic . 
SUBJECTIVE:this is a children's film in the truest sense . it's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it's great for the kids . parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil
SUBJECTIVE:as simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine . this is a movie you can trust . 
SUBJECTIVE:whaley's performance is earnest and often riveting , but he should have taken a few lessons from his peers at amateur night . 
SUBJECTIVE:like rudy yellow lodge , eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider . 
SUBJECTIVE:resident evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail . 
SUBJECTIVE:if you ever wondered what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera , this oscar-nominated documentary takes you there . 
SUBJECTIVE:the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear .

SUBJECTIVE:very annie-mary is familiar but winningly funny and good-hearted . 
SUBJECTIVE:provides a porthole into that noble , trembling incoherence that defines us all . 
SUBJECTIVE:despite bearing the paramount imprint , it's a bargain-basement european pickup . what's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
SUBJECTIVE:post 9/11 the philosophical message of " personal freedom first " might not be as palatable as intended . 
SUBJECTIVE:what makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music . 
SUBJECTIVE:offers a gentle summer fantasy for both grown-ups and little ones . 
SUBJECTIVE:an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
SUBJECTIVE:while its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer's appetite , the film's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving . 
SUBJECTIVE:what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent . 
SUBJECTIVE:the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell . 
SUBJECTIVE:perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy . 
SUBJECTIVE:the film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission . . . if " gory mayhem " is your idea of a good time . 
SUBJECTIVE:it's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth . 
SUBJECTIVE:there are moments in this account of the life of artist frida kahlo that are among cinema's finest this year . unfortunately , they're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of kahlo's life imaginable . 
SUBJECTIVE:ratliff speaks the truth about these pentecostal extremists with fairness and compassion , while the well-intentioned churchgoers shout only semi-truths in a frightfully un-christlike fashion .

SUBJECTIVE:what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ? 
SUBJECTIVE:the plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story . but while the highly predictable narrative falls short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold .

SUBJECTIVE: . . . plenty of warmth to go around , with music and laughter and the love of family . 
SUBJECTIVE:[hayek] throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and she gradually makes us believe she is kahlo . 
SUBJECTIVE:the unexplored story opportunities of " punch-drunk love " may have worked against the maker's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer/director anderson .

SUBJECTIVE:like " this is spinal tap " , only with more pathetic protagonists- and funnier ! 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie addresses a hungry need for pg-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it doesn't go too much further . 
SUBJECTIVE:while 'manhunter' takes the prize for stylishness , 'dragon' is much scarier and more emotionally involving . 
SUBJECTIVE:it seems lawrence has reflected deeply upon his down periods . they've left him wiser without dulling the sharp edges of his humor .

SUBJECTIVE:this sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem . 
SUBJECTIVE:smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way . 
SUBJECTIVE:an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg's the prince of egypt from 1998 . 
SUBJECTIVE:salma goes native and she's never been better in this colorful bio-pic of a mexican icon . 
SUBJECTIVE:a film that is a portrait of grace in an imperfect world . 
SUBJECTIVE:what the movie lacks in action it more than makes up for in drama , suspense , revenge , and romance . 
SUBJECTIVE:relieved of the action-stalling expository responsibility that dogs so many movies based on superhero comics , blade 2 goes straight for the jugular . 
SUBJECTIVE:watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 
SUBJECTIVE:there's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers . 
SUBJECTIVE:hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world . 
SUBJECTIVE:another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . 
SUBJECTIVE:august -- a pupil of ingmar bergman's -- manages to tell a tragic tale while avoiding the heavy-laden angst of a bergman film . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs . 
SUBJECTIVE:rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie sticks much closer to hornby's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of high fidelity did .

SUBJECTIVE:what's next ? the porky's revenge : ultimate edition ? 
SUBJECTIVE:there ain't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it's hilarious .

SUBJECTIVE:the stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt . 
SUBJECTIVE:fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , isn't really one of resources . 
SUBJECTIVE:a haunted , bountiful film that demands patience -- and rewards it . 
SUBJECTIVE:the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
SUBJECTIVE:it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one . 
SUBJECTIVE:an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . 
SUBJECTIVE:visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality .
